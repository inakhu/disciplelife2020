Let two members share their experiences of meeting with a monarch or a top-rank officer at their place of work and how they honoured the individual .<\/p>\r\n","opening_remark":"<p>How we view God and our response to His awesomeness matters a lot. Worship is not limited to singing as some people think; it is a spiritual discipline. Worship is an intentional expression of reverence and honour that we attribute to God as we experience Him daily. We can engage in worship either personally or corporately. Either way, it is an intentional activity welling up from a grateful heart that has reflected on the person and the deeds of God. As we continue this discussion, let us open our hearts to reflect on Gods awesomeness and then worship Him accordingly<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Personal Worship<\/strong> Personal worship is an expression of an individuals response to God and His deeds. Like an individual will respond to the presence of a monarch or a top-rank officer at the workplace, and even more, believers should respond to God in awesome adoration. Prophet Isaiah is a good example of one who rendered personal worship to God. In Isaiah 25:1, he declared that he would exalt and praise God. The subsequent verses show that his worship of God was borne out of what he observed about God and His deeds. He had seen God as the One who does wonderful things (v. 1), the refuge and shelter of the poor (v. 4), the defender (v. 5), the provider (v. 6), the comforter and Saviour (vv. 7-9), etc. His worship is a description of his experience of God. We can thus say that personal worship as a spiritual discipline is:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Experiential - It is a product of an individuals experience of God. As one experiences God, one responds in worship of Him. This is reflected in our perception of Him and His dealings with us.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Intentional - Worship is a deliberate activity; that is why it is a spiritual discipline. To worship God with the whole of our being calls for making intentional effort to ponder on the person and the acts of God. This may require that we deny ourselves of certain pleasures like watching our favourite programmes on TV, or abstaining from spending much time on social media, purposely to have adequate time to reflect on the goodness of God and respond to Him in worship.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Expressive - Worship involves communicating with God. Our expression of worship may be verbal, non-verbal or a combination of both. For instance, one may bow before God, lift up ones hands in humble adoration, roll on the floor or do other non-verbal activities as a way of worshipping God. At the same time, one may burst into singing, engage in praise chants or use other verbal means to acknowledge the awesomeness of God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Sincere - Worship is not mere lip service; it ensues from a grateful heart. Worship, whether personal or corporate, is not aimed at impressing anyone. Rather, the goal of worship is to express our honest acknowledgement of God and appreciation for His deeds. Therefore, worship should naturally flow from a sincere heart and should be a genuine offering to our God.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>1.

Corporate Worship<\/strong> Corporate worship is the response of a group of people to the person and acts of God. It may be a family, small group, or the church as a whole. Revelation chapter 4 presents an example of a corporate worship involving the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures. Their exposure to the glamorous throne of God, with all its adornments, sparked up the response of worship in them. Their songs indicate that they worshipped God:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. For who He is, verse 8: Holy, holy, holy Is the Lord God Almighty Who was, and is, and is to come. (We see this song replicated in the hymn for today).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. For what He has done, verse 11: You are worthy, our Lord and God, To receive glory and honour and power, For you created all things, And by your will they were created And have their being.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the twenty-four elders and four living creatures could worship God in the beauty of His holiness, believers in Christ should not be left out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are to respond to God for whom He is and for His wonderful deeds. 1 Peter 2:9 emphasises that we are created to ...declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Therefore, our reflection of how God has chosen us as a people whom He has made His special possession should lead us to an act of worship. It must be noted, however, that the quality of our acts of personal worship will determine the quality of our corporate worship<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Suggest ways families can improve on the spiritual discipline of worship.<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Worship, as a spiritual discipline, demands our readiness as Christs disciples to deny ourselves certain pleasures and indulgences to concentrate on the person and deeds of God.

We also take time to chew food in order to enjoy the taste, ease its passage through the throat, and enhance the digestion process, thereby ultimately making it useful for the body.

The Process of Meditation Meditation<\/strong> is a significant way of handling the Word of God. It is the act of taking the Word of God beyond our eyes and heads into our hearts. It involves paying closer attention to the Word as we concentrate on it and dig deeper to get the treasure therein. Like every other spiritual discipline, meditation demands that we withdraw from every form of distractions to concentrate on the Word of God. This may mean switching off our phones, missing our favourite programme(s) on television, missing out of an interesting gist with our friends, losing some sleep just to wake up early to pay attention to Gods Word. We may even miss or delay a meal because we have purposed to feed our hearts before feeding our bodies. It requires that we deny ourselves some things in order to have adequate time for the Word of God. This is the sacrifice we have to make to enhance our spiritual sensitivity through meditation. For effective engagement in the spiritual discipline of meditation, we need the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Withdrawal from Distraction - We need to always withdraw to a quiet place either within the house, out-door (a garden) or have a secluded place where we can be alone with God. This also includes putting off our phone(s) or leaving them in silent mode and other electronic gadgets to avoid distraction. Remember, God is all-important and His Word is loaded with treasures greater than whatever we may miss by being temporarily out of the reach of friends and business associates.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. The Bible - The Word of God should be the basis for our meditation, so we need a Bible. Access to multiple versions may also be of help. As we read and ponder on the Word, we may need to consult other versions for clarity and deeper understanding of the passage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Writing Materials - As we meditate, the Word of God comes alive in us. We may need to put down Gods instructions to us from His Word. Our writing materials will be useful at this time. Keeping records during our moments of meditation will also help us monitor how well we are growing spiritually. It will be like the medical chat with which a patients vital signs are monitored.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Connection with the Holy Spirit - The Bible says, ... the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life (2 Corinthians 3:6b). The Holy Spirit is the One who breathes on the written Word to enliven it. When we are connected to the Holy Spirit, He sets His searchlight on particular portions of the Scripture for our attention and those portions come alive to us. Until Gods Word comes alive in us, it may not have full effect on us. Therefore, our partnership with the Holy Spirit is essential in our act of meditation.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Discuss the process of meditation.

The child wanted to know what they have done that God does not like. Should confession be a regular part of a disciples life? Should it even be listed among spiritual disciplines? (Allow class members to brainstorm on this.)<\/p>\r\n","opening_remark":"<p>Yes, No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because Gods seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God (1 John 3:9). But what should a disciple, who is born of God, do when he falls into sin? Such a disciple needs to swallow his pride and own up to his fault. As Christs disciples, we must come before God in sincere acknowledgement and confession of our sins, remembering that Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. (Proverbs 28:13) It takes brokenness and spiritual maturity to own up to a fault, especially when we think we have a name among brethren. Thus, only disciples who have denied self and are always ready to do what God says will practise confession.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. The Spiritual Discipline Called Confession<\/strong> On most occasions, we limit confession to the disclosure of wrongdoing in erring situations. Beyond that, confession includes agreeing with the Word of God. In classifying confession among responding prayer, T. W. Hunt and Claude V. King, in the discipleship manual: In Gods Presence, states that Confession is agreeing with the truth, it is agreeing with God about the real you and responding to Gods holiness. (1994:38) Going by this definition, confession is essentially the act of agreeing with what God sees or says about us. If then, our image, in the light of how God sees us, is that of a sinner, we will do well to agree with God by acknowledging our sins and confessing them. If self or the devil condemns us to an image other than what God says we are, confession is a ready tool with which we can disagree with the myopic presentation and the distorted image projected by the devil about us in order to agree with how God sees us. As Christs disciples, we must understand this and be ready to engage in confession as often as necessary.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What will a disciple need to forgo in order to be able to engage in confessing appropriately?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Confession of Sins<\/strong> Confession of sins is one of the dimensions to spiritual discipline. It means a disciple beholds God in His holiness, sees his own limitations and inadequacies and then agrees with God as he acknowledges and confesses his sins. The question of the little child in the opening story is a vital one regarding how often we should confess our sins. A disciple should aspire to live a life free of sin but should never indulge in self-deceit and pretence when a sin is discovered. 1 John 1:8 says If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. As we grow in our walk with God, we will discover the aspects of our lives we need to work on and should respond to by confessing such inadequacies. The Bible is replete with examples of people who walked and worked with God, yet had some sins lurking in their lives. David, the man after Gods heart, is a biblical example of a servant of God who confesses his sins (2 Samuel 12). Isaiah, the blunt prophet, is another example; he had been declaring woes on others (Isaiah 1- 5) before he also saw himself in the light of Gods holiness and acknowledged his inadequacies (Isaiah 6:1-6). Daniel also identified the sins of his nation and confessed same before God (Daniel 9).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Identify a collective sin as a group of people (as a family, a church or even a nation) and confess it to God.<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Confession of the Word of God<\/strong> As earlier clarified, confession is not limited to the disclosure of wrongdoings; it also extends to agreeing with the truth of the Word of God about us. The composer of Baptist Hymnal 210 probably nd rd recognised this as the 2 and 3 stanzas of the song extends beyond confession of sins to laying claim of what God can do in ones life. This second dimension of confession involves the declaration of what God says in His Word about us. Confession of Gods Word is based on other spiritual disciplines involving the Word of God such as meditation (which we considered last week). When we meditate on Gods Word, we get to know His mind about us and confess same. A disciple who cannot make-out time to study the Word of God cannot possibly tap into the depth of Gods resources for confession. Therefore, it takes a disciplined Christian life of digging deep into the Word to correctly engage in the confession of Gods Word. Remember that the Bible says, A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him. (Matthew 12:35a) We need to be loaded with the Word of God. By doing so, the good stored up in us will erupt from our confession. The practice of confessing Gods Word also requires that we abstain from corrupt communication so as not to use the same mouth with which we claim Gods word to pull down what God has in store for us (James 3:9-12).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>Members should point out some truths in Gods Word that talk about our corporate situations and confess them.<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Confession, as a spiritual discipline, is necessary for every disciple of Christ to grow unto maturity.

They wear long faces and refuse to loosen up thinking their hyper-serious look is a show of their spiritual vibrancy. Some still carry this hyperserious attitude to Gods presence such that they fail to express joy even in worship. They sometimes look down on those who are expressive in Gods presence as being the unserious ones. Such believers have a distorted view of what indicates spiritual inclination. In the place of worship, it is important to always loosen up and express our joy. Today, we want to study a spiritual discipline that gives a blend of serious and relaxed dispositions in our Christian living and worship.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p>Celebration has to do with being joyful. It goes beyond external expression of happiness to internal, deep-seated joy in the heart of a believer. It is not what anybody pretends to possess; it is what erupts from the heart of a believer regardless of his\/her status and circumstances. It relates directly with the expressive nature of worship and so it may be expressed as a personal or corporate worship experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I. Imperatives of Celebration <\/strong>Psalm 100:1-5 contains six imperative sentences encouraging believers to celebrate as they worship God with their lives. These imperatives are considered below:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Shout for joy - this is the very first imperative in Psalm 100. The psalmist admonishes all the earth to shout for joy to the LORD. Shouting for joy is apparently not a moody action; rather, it is an expression of excitement revealing inner joy to the Lord who is the source of joy. Thus Christs disciples are free to express their excitement before the Lord not because they want to impress anyone but because they want to acknowledge God, the giver of joy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Worship with gladness - the psalmist continues by specifying that all the earth should worship God with gladness. One who will worship God with gladness is definitely not one who is tied up to some negative feelings. Rather, they must be people who have learnt to forget about self when worshipping the allsufficient God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Come with joyful songs - there are different songs; some are expressive of joy and others are not (e.g. dirge). Celebration, as a spiritual discipline, demands that the disciple should approach Gods presence (in personal or corporate worship) with joyful songs by night and day, in gladness and in woe as Stanza 3 of BH 17 says.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Know that the Lord is God - the awareness of the sovereignty of God will make the believer celebrate, even in difficult times. Knowing God and being conscious of our relationship with Him enhances our capacity to celebrate at all times.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. Enter with thanksgiving and praise - this fifth imperative of celebration from Psalm 100 encourages the believer to be reflective upon the blessings of God. Such reflection will result in an attitude of thanksgiving and praise to Him. It is believed that whoever can think deeply will be very appreciative. Celebration calls for reflective consideration of Gods deed, which results in thanksgiving and praise to God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>f. Give thanks and praise - it is one thing to enter Gods presence with thanks and praise, it is a higher commitment to offer thanksgiving and praise. Self-consciousness and distraction may interrupt a disciples intention of giving God praise. Disciples of Christ should exercise discipline so as not to allow anything to hinder their celebration before God. Michal would have distracted David from offering thanksgiving and praises before God but for the restraint David exercised in not responding to Michals appeal to his self-esteem (2 Samuel 6:20-22).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>1. Does self-righteousness translate into true spirituality?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. How can a disciple overcome hindrances to these imperatives of celebration?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Benefits of Celebration <\/strong>Many benefits abound when we engage in the spiritual discipline of celebration. Below, a few of those benefits are identified.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. We draw strength from the spiritual exercise. The Bible says, The joy of the Lord is our strength. (Nehemiah 8:10b) When we engage in celebration, we allow the joy of the Lord to permeate our hearts, and we draw strength from it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. We overcome tendencies of depression. Depression creeps into a mans life when one starts to brood over unpleasant experiences and fear of the unknown. Engaging in celebration shuts the door against depression as one leaves no room for negative thoughts to breed. Instead, concentrating on who God is (i.e. imperative d) and different modes of expression of joy in Gods presence naturally kills the seeds of depression.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Celebration enhances our expression of faith in God. As a matter of fact, celebration itself is an expression of faith in God. When we engage in celebration, despite our circumstances, we are invariably declaring that our God is more than able to perfect all that concerns us.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Celebration boosts our lifestyle of evangelism. When we are always radiant, reflecting the inner joy that transcends the happenings around us, the unbelievers around will like to know the secret of our radiance. That creates an avenue for us to witness Christ to them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. Celebration strengthens our worship of God and boosts other spiritual disciplines. As earlier mentioned, celebration itself is a part of worship. When we worship God in the beauty of His holiness, we know Him better. Our better understanding of God depends on our deep meditation on His Word. Our knowledge of Him enables us to see ourselves in the light of His perception and image. This in turn leads us to make confessions in agreement with Gods view of us.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Identify some biblical examples of instances of celebration.<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>As Christs disciples, we can be serious with our spiritual walk and still be joyful.

It happened during the Nigerian Baptist Convention-inSession at Okelerin, Ogbomoso. The women were encouraged to hold a meeting during the Convention and so with some men, they carried benches and walked towards a nearby isin (local apple) tree. Since then, the women carried on with their meetings and programmes while pastors and lay leaders assisted them. Miss Susan Anderson and Miss Neale Young (who were missionaries to Nigeria) and Mrs. Mojola Agbebi were prominent women who helped to steer the leadership of the Womens Missionary Union. The Sunbeam Band also called Egbe Irawo (a group for boys and girls) started in 1919 (the same year Baptist Womens Missionary Union was formed). In 1925, Girls Auxiliary (a group for teenage girls) started and Lydia Auxiliary (young ladies group) was established in 1952. From inception, the purpose of the union has been to carry out missions and it has not changed till today. The tiny seed that was planted in 1919 has become a big tree with many branches and fruits.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baptist Womens Missionary Union continues to make mission impacts even beyond the borders of Nigeria. In the Baptist World Alliance, she is recognised as a strong supportive partner. She plays the role of a grandmother and mother to other unions in Africa. Trainings and mission supports are organised regularly for countries like Benin Republic, Mali, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Ghana and other African countries to educate and empower them for mission work.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>1.

Sunbeam Band is the first group involving children from birth to 3years and for boys and girls between ages 4 and 9. The purpose is to help children know the Lord and grow to become like Him. In addition, children are taught how to talk to their heavenly Father, hide Gods Word in their hearts through Bible stories and memory verse recitations, learn about other children of the world, help others for Jesus sake and give money to aid the spread of the Gospel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Girls Auxiliary is the group for young girls between ages 10 and 16. They are guided to abide in God through prayer, advance in wisdom by studying the Bible, acknowledge that they are stewards of their time, money and personality, adorn themselves with good works and lastly, to accept the Great Commission. The girls undergo discipleship training called G.A. Forward Steps and Mission Study.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lydia Auxiliary comprises young ladies from 17 years old till marriage. The purpose of bringing ladies within this age group together is to emphasise and encourage Christian living, Bible study, prayer, soulwinning, holiness and giving towards missions. The ladies are encouraged to do Mission Awards: Service, Honour and Missionary Awards, which require praying for missions and missionaries, giving regularly to worldwide missions, studying the messages of missionaries in the Bible and going to mission fields among others. Successful completion of these requirements certifies them as missionaries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Womens Missionary Society encompasses all Baptist married women of all ages. Women meet to discuss how to contribute to the development of the kingdom, be good wives to their husbands and responsible mothers to their children. They mentor young ones by providing leadership for them. This is done by choosing from among them leaders and advisers for the Sunbeams, GAs and Lydias. Women also visit mission fields annually to preach the Gospel, help the needy, sponsor student pastors, build church structures, houses for missionaries and donate materials for the progress of mission work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside the four organisations of the Womens Missionary Union are four Fundamentals which are Prayer, Bible and Mission Study, Stewardship and Service, and Evangelism and Missions. They are the four pillars upon which WMU mission efforts are built. The fundamentals help the children, young girls, young ladies and women to pray for missions, missionaries, churches and for themselves. Members study Gods Word, mission principles in the Bible and mission efforts all over the world. They learn to be good stewards of time, treasures and talents and give sacrificially towards the progress of Gods work. Members are committed to evangelism in their neighbourhood, and on mission fields.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>WMU organises camps, retreats and workshops at Camp Young, Ede for all groups throughout the year to revive, reawaken, teach, train, assess and encourage them for more commitment to missions.

This is because men are very crucial in the plans of God for the world. They are also leaders at home, churches, communities and the global society. Understanding and promoting the ministry of Mens Missionary Union in our Convention is, therefore, important. The name Mens Missionary Union is a union of two major organizations. They are The Baptist Mens Fellowship (BMF) and the Royal Ambassadors of Nigeria (RAN). The ministry of the two organizations can be categorised into three, vis, MISSIONS, DISCIPLESHIP AND FELLOWSHIP. Our discussion will, therefore, be directed towards these three areas of Christian ministry in relation to the vision and mission statements of the union as follows: <strong>Vision<\/strong>: To become the foremost men moulding organisation in Africa and beyond.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mission: <\/strong>Equipping men for life and godliness through preaching, power, praise, possession and purpose.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. DISCIPLESHIP <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a man is not just by virtue of sex, but of character. Therefore, men in the church must demonstrate Christian character or virtues. The Mens Missionary Union is aimed at building godly character in the lives of Baptist men through her various programmes. The vision is to help every Baptist man become mature into the following competencies:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Spiritual competence - Building and developing their spiritual lives, and the God factor (Proverbs 1:7, 20-33; 2:1-22; 3:1-26; 4:1-9, 10-13; 6:16-19; 7:1-5; 8:1-11, 12-21, 22-31, 32-36; 9:1- 6, 10-12).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Physical competence - It includes skill or career development, accountability, building fiscal capital, physical capacity, finance and work related ethics (Proverbs 6:6-11; 10:4-6, 16- 17, 26; 12:11, 24, 27; 13:4, 7, 11-12, 22-23; 14:4, 20, 23-24; 15:19; 18:9, 11; 19:4, 7, 14, 15, 24).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Social competence - Ability to manage relationships with wife, children, siblings, other women and colleagues, maintain good neighbourliness, cultivate respect for parents, and create meaningful network of friends (Proverbs 1:8-9; 6:1-5, 12-15; 9:7-12, 13-18; 10:6-12, 23-25, 30-32; 11:1-6, 7-11, 15, 16-21).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Emotional competence - Mastery of self and emotions,understanding emotions such as anger, pride, covetousness, etc. and decorum (Proverbs 1:10-19; 3:31-35; 4:14-19, 20-27; 5:1-5, 7-14, 15-23; 6:20-29, 30-35; 7:6-23, 24-27; 10:18-21; 11:12-14; 12:12, 16, 25; 13:2-3, 7, 10; 14:3, 15-18).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. Mental Competence - Acquiring skills, knowledge and growing in wisdom (Proverbs 1:1-6; 10:1, 13-14; 12:22; 14:35; 15:14; 16:22, 31; 17:16, 24; 18:15, 16; 19:8, 20:5, 18, 29; 21:16, 22; 23:23; 24:3-7; 29:3, 30:24-31).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of all the above is to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create happy attitude for worship and capacity to thirst after spiritual things.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Cultivate happy emotions for meaningful relationship with family and people.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Empower and acquire skills for boosting of finance and favour for happy living.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Empower every man to be a minister.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Suggest other ways of helping the men and boys of your church to build godly Christian character.<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. MISSIONS<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mission is the primary responsibility of Mens Missionary Union. The name of the union even bears credence to this. The various competencies discussed earlier are to ultimately prepare men for effective mission and evangelistic activities. Such competencies are necessary for productive witnessing. Men must be involved in missions because there are multitudes of people who have needs that can be best met through the efforts of Christian men. The organizations involvement in missions can clearly be seen in these different ways.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Funding of Home and International Missions: The men and boys of the Nigerian Baptist Convention on a yearly basis budget for the funding of Home and International Mission Fields. This is replicated at the church, Association and Conference levels. Specific projects in mission fields are identified for funding. This is mostly done through the Global Missions Board (GMB) of the Convention. Also, Conferences are grouped in a manner that all the International Mission Fields of Global Missions Board are covered for funding and for mission visitations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Mission Visitation: The organization is also involved in mission visitations for ministration. There is the annual MISSION SAFARI at the national level. This is a mission visitation exercise and ministration to any of the International Mission Fields of the Global Missions Board. The purpose is to provide practical ministration to the people on the field. It is also to encourage leaders and members of the churches on the field. It provides opportunity to evaluate the needs of the people on the field so as to effectively determine how to help them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Church Planting: Many churches have been planted by the Mens Missionary Union of local Baptist churches, Associations and Conferences. These churches are nurtured and financed by the organization until they become organized churches. This includes the calling of Pastors who will provide pastoral and spiritual leadership for those churches. The Royal Ambassadors of Nigeria is presently sponsoring a church (Calvary Baptist Church) in Imesi-Ile, Osun State. This church was established four years ago when it was discovered that there was no Baptist church in the ancient town.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Sponsoring of Revivals and Crusades: At the church level, Baptist men and boys sponsor church revivals and crusades. This is done by providing the necessary fund needed for the hosting of such programmes. They are also involved in mobilising unbelievers to attend. In addition, they provide prayer and logistic support for the success of such revivals and crusades. By these, they are supporting the evangelistic ministry of the church.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Evaluate the mission activities of your church Mens Missionary Union in line with the above.<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. FELLOWSHIP<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weekly meeting and vocational cell groups of the Mens Missionary Union provides strong Christian fellowship. Since it is easy to be shaped by ones environment, the vision of MMU is to create a Christian environment that will positively shape her members. When members are in right and positive Christian environment, they will grow to become strong Christians. Therefore, each man needs to be a part of a positive community where strong relationship can be developed. This is what the fellowship meetings of MMU seek to provide. Each persons needs are addressed by providing support for one another. For example, vocational cell groups do the caring, the praying, the visitation and the need meeting for every member of their cell groups. Friendship becomes more meaningful when people come together and meet one anothers needs. A community of believers that love one another is a great testimony to the lost world about the love of Christ (John 13:35). Such effective fellowship will also achieve the following for the church:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Enhance unity and oneness in the church.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Provide friendly environment for new comers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Provide opportunity for members to discover or re-discover themselves.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d.

Brief Historical Background of the Local Baptist Church Youth Fellowship <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of Nigerian Baptist Conventions (NBC) Youth Ministry can be traced to the first 50 years of the 20th century and it started like a movement from different parts of the country. Churches like the First Baptist Church, 24A Broad Street Lagos and Bethel Baptist Church Sapele played significant roles in instituting the youth fellowship in local Baptist churches. Similarly, God used the roles played by people like Rev. Joseph A. Adegbite of blessed memory, Pa S. Ako Onofekohwo, Pa Noah Ola Iyanda and Rev. Goke Adeleke of blessed memory among others to bring recognition to the youth fellowship of the Nigerian Baptist Convention both at the national and international levels. The motivation for this organ of the NBC came from the Baptist World Youth Conference around the middle of the 20th century. However, the Nigerian Baptist Convention Youth Conference was formally inaugurated on August 2, 1972 as a response to a circular, which was released to notify all Baptist Churches in the NBC of the approval of the denomination to begin the NBCYC. In the words of S. Ako Onofekohwo, it was after the official inauguration of the Nigerian Baptist Convention Youth Conference in August 1973 that work began to penetrate into Conferences, Associations and local churches of the Convention. This implies that most of the local church youth fellowships of the Nigerian Baptist Convention started after 1973. The leadership of the Baptist Student Fellowship from late 1950s also complemented the activities of the Youth ministry since its inauguration.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"","interaction2":"<p><strong>II.

In addition to spiritual training, the youth ministry is designed to help equip youths for social development as they socialize in a godly atmosphere, all to the glory of God. It is also an avenue to provide a variety of opportunities and experiences to draw youths into active and responsible participation in mission work and work of the faith community at large.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Importance of Youths to the Local Church <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right from the days of the Bible, many youths were commissioned for different kingdom assignments that blessed peoples lives in their days. Among them are Daniel, Joseph, Esther and many others. Also, in this contemporary time, many youths have been called and used by God to bless this generation. In fulfilling the purpose for which the church exists, which include: worship, fellowship, discipleship, service and outreach, youths cannot be left out of this great task if Gods work will be carried out. Many youths that have known Christ have impacted the church in so many ways because of their exposure, capability and zeal for Gods work.

Although youths have a lot of excesses, yet many are zealous and committed to the growth of the church and her ministries. The following are some of the areas where the impact of youths are felt in the church:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Outreach <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of their programmes, they organise outreaches to preach the Gospel to both the reached and the unreached. Examples include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> Village Outreach: Youths go to remote places to witness Christ to those living there. They organise free medical services (by the professional health workers among them), preaching, teaching the Word of God, film show, drama, etc.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Street Evangelism: This is also called house-to-house evangelism. Youths go to houses near and far to share the Gospel of Christ with others, either in groups or individually.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Hospital Evangelism: Youths go to hospitals to preach, counsel and pray with the sick and their relatives who are taking care of them.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Children Evangelism: Youths preach to children in and outside the church in order to catch them young for Christ. Some youths are into children ministry in their local churches.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Recreational Activities: Youths organise recreational activities for the purpose of preaching the Gospel through sporting activities like football, table tennis, lawn tennis, and other indoor games like Ludo, whot, scrabble, etc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Sacrificial Services<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> Serve in the Church-in-Council: Since youths are tomorrows leaders, they are allowed to be part of the church-in-council because they are young and more oriented, more exposed and more civilised. This is to enable them learn, contribute and prepare them for the task ahead.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Serve in the Music Ministry of the Church: In almost all churches, youths are the ones playing musical instruments of the church - drums of all kinds, guitar, keyboard, saxophone and many others. They are also good in singing, coordinating others and they serve as choir leaders.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Serve in Decorating the Church: Youths are innovative. As a result, they use their gift to give the church a befitting outlook, especially in the decoration of the church auditorium during special celebrations like Easter, Christmas, Harvest thanksgiving and other important celebrations of the church. Also, planting of flowers and beautification of the environment is important to them. Serve in Drama Ministry of the Church: Youths are gifted in preaching the Gospel through drama. There are testimonies of many who got to know the Lord through the drama ministry of the church. Since youths are still agile, they have the ability to act and stage dramas for the expansion of the kingdom of God.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n","sharing_time4":"<p>1.

The Nigerian Baptist Convention yielded in obedience to this command through the help and ministry of Miss Mary Frank Kirkpatrick, the mother and pioneer missionary to students in the Nigerian Baptist Convention. She arrived Nigeria in 1956 and began ministering to students at Ibadan Boys High School, Ibadan. A student fellowship was organised and it was called Baptist Student Union (BSU) . The BSU began to gain ground and grew among students in various schools until in 1958 when University of Ibadan students requested for a worship opportunity. This request gave birth to University of Ibadan Baptist Church, which is within the University of Ibadan. Now, there are over two hundred (200) campuses within the nation collaborating with students in six different countries. These countries are; Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cote Dvoire and Uganda.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this ministry, God has used various people like; Revd Thomas Kennedy, Miss Nar Owens, Miss Bettye Anne McQueen, Revd Philip Wilson, Prof. Emiola Nihinlola, Rev Daniel Ogundayo, Revd Jeffrey Salako, Rev. Dr Joshua Oladapo, late Revd Tayo Orodiji of blessed memory, Revd Moses Orukotan, Revd Gideon Akanbi and now Revd IbukunOluwa Joshua at the national office with many others who served in various capacities in the office as well as on the field. Therefore, since schools are engaged in the quest for knowledge and truth of which God is the Source, the Christian perspective is essential to realise the ultimate in education. The unique nature of the student life and campus community demands a specialised ministry of the church to the individual need of students for redemption and Christian nurture within that community. It is this unique nature and challenge that gave birth to Baptist Student Ministry also called Baptist Student Fellowship (BSF).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What gave birth to the Student Ministry of the Nigerian Baptist Convention? Allow one or two persons whom God has used in this ministry either on campus or in your local church to share their experience as a member of this group.<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Purpose of Baptist Students Ministry<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Baptist Students Ministry of the Nigerian Baptist Convention was organised for the purpose of achieving the following objectives:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> To lead students into commitment to accept Jesus Christ as their Saviour and Lord.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> To involve them in the study of biblical truths and Christian discipleship.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> To lead them to relate academic disciplines to their Christian faith.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> To involve them in responsible church membership; denominational understanding, and participation.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> \u00b7To involve them in the study and practical participation in missions for kingdom expansion.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> To help students maintain consistent Christian walk with specific emphasis on disciplines of the Christian life (e.g. prayer, Bible study, personal witnessing, and ministering to others).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Functional Areas of the Student Ministry Division of Baptist Convention <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Baptist Students Ministry has a functional unit at the Nigerian Baptist Convention Headquarters in Ibadan. It is called Students Ministry Division. The following are some of the activities they carry out:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Programme Design: The Students Ministry Division is responsible for designing the programme of activities adaptable for use on campuses, in churches, Associations, Conferences, and the Convention.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Publication of Materials: The Students Ministry Division makes available some materials to serve as guidelines for establishing Baptist Students Organizations on campuses, or in a local church. The division provides materials for strengthening and improving student organizations (e.g. promotional materials, Bible study, leadership training courses, discipleship courses, outreach programme outline and retreat plans). In addition, the division makes available a daily devotional guide annually called Seek Daily.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Field Services: The Students Ministry Division makes available personnel to assist in the establishment, development, promotion and coordination of students ministry (vision and programmes) on any campus or local Baptist church within the Convention.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Conferences: The Students Ministry Division encourages and promotes Associational, Conference and National student programmes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. Accountability: The Student Ministry Division gives report of her work and ministry activities to the Convention.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>f. Missions: The Student Ministry Division plans and mobilises students and execute mission activities.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"<p><strong>Baptist Students Fellowship Programmes<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Student Ministries Division put together programme of activities that are done during fellowship for students in both campuses and churches. This meeting together of students provides varied opportunities for Christian students who by background or preference adhere to Baptist doctrines to experience disciplines that encourage spiritual growth, and the sharing of their faith with others. The activities include worship, prayer, visitation, Bible study, fellowship, stewardship, missions and the practice of Christian discipleship in all aspects of life. Also, part of the activities is evangelism where they share their personal experience of faith in Christ with others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Worship: During worship, students pray, sing songs of praises to God and express their devotion to God in a setting with their peer group. They also influence other nonChristian students to accept Christ as their Saviour and Lord through the sharing of testimonies, and meeting the needs of the needy among them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. Prayer: They organise prayer meetings where they engage in individual and corporate communion with God. Through prayers, they have the opportunity of confessing their sins, interceding for one another and supplicate for themselves. Just as blood is to the body so is prayer to the Christian.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Bible Study:Here, students seek to know God more through the study of the Scriptures. The Bible is the record of Gods revelation to humankind and this is expressed through Jesus Christ. In addition, other programmes are organised during Bible study such as talks and seminars on Bible subjects or on other relevant issues as regards their lives from biblical perspective.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>iv. Discipleship: Here, students are helped to grow spiritually by learning from Christ, living under His authority, applying the teachings to every area of life through obedience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>v. Fellowship: The Baptist Students Ministry is an organisation of Christian students coming together to experience a sense of oneness in their community. They plan activities where students can experience meaningful relationships with fellow students; senior friends and other Christians for the purpose of building a deepened Christian community. The campus fellowship is a favourable example of a broader fellowship within the community of the local church.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>vi. Stewardship: Through the ministry, Christian students are empowered to be stewards of God-given resources. Christian stewards are also called to be faithful and responsible in the use of their body, time, influence, material possessions, gifts, etc., to Gods glory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>vii. Visitation: Christian students are encouraged to meet the needs of others through visitation to the lonely, counselling other students on matters of personal morality, crisis situation, decision-making, grief experiences and assisting in tutoring other young students in their areas of academic difficulties. Also through visitation, Christian students try to locate, enlist, and involve new students in her activities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>viii. Missions and Evangelism: Since missions is the heart beat of God, Christian students are encouraged to be involved in mission activities as well as witnessing through organisation of outreaches to the unsaved. Here, they have the opportunity of sharing their conversion and Christian life experience with others for the purpose of bringing them into the knowledge of our Saviour and Lord. Thus, Christian students have the opportunity of spreading the Gospel on campus, visiting villages, planning and mobilizing others to execute mission activities for global harvest.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time4":"<p>How best can your church attract students in the church towards participating in Baptist Student Fellowship?<\/p>\r\n","closing_remark":"<p>The Baptist Students Fellowship is a blessing to our generation.

If the education sector is effective, less will be spent on other sectors in terms of money, time and efforts. This, perhaps, is what informed why UNICEF recommends that twenty six percent of national budget be voted for education. Therefore, to improve and transform education, government has important roles to perform.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. GOVERNMENT AND EDUCATION<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having realised that the role of education in the socio-economic and political development of Nigeria is indispensable, the federal government has adopted education as an instrument par excellence for affecting national development. In order to accomplish this laudable objective, the federal government formulated a national policy on education, which specifies the objectives of each level of education - nursery, primary, secondary and tertiary. The federal government recognises and encourages the participation of private individuals and organization at all levels (national, state and local levels) of the nation. We have several private nursery, primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions belonging to individuals and non-governmental organizations. This is a welcome development that has made education interesting and competitive and has led to increase in the quality of education.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>For a brighter education system in Nigeria, the right people must be put at the helm of affairs, how can we ensure this?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. GOVERNMENTS ROLES<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of governments roles in transforming education in the country include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Formulation of Policies A policy is used to designate the manner of governing a nation or an organisation. It is a system or measure which the leadership of an establishment adopts or pursues, as best adapted to the interests of the establishment. Educational policies are formulated by the government in line with the overall vision of the countrys leadership. Educational policies are carefully structured to address the shortcomings in different sectors of the country and aid positive transformation of the entire nation. overall vision of the countrys leadership. Educational policies are carefully structured to address the shortcomings in different sectors of the country and aid positive transformation of the entire nation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Funding Funding of education is the primary responsibility of the government. The huge financial demand of education may be the reason for the inclusion of the private sector to assist the government. The early Christian missionaries who brought education to Nigeria were responsible for the financing of schools through donations, local contributions and gifts from foreign organisations. Though the financial input of the Nigerian government to the education sector has increased from about six per cent to about nine per cent of the national budget, this is still very low compared to the twenty six per cent recommended by UNICEF. To improve on the standard of education in Nigeria, government therefore need to increase its allocation to the education sector and ensure its appropriate circulation and utilization.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Supervision Supervision has to do with overseeing the activities of a people for the purpose of bringing about improvement. This supervision is concerned with quality control in schools. Government plays the role of providing supervision for the education sector to ensure that those implementing policies comply with its provisions. To have educational transformation in Nigeria, supervision should be carried out with all seriousness. Effective supervision should be carried out on school administrators, school management, teachers, school facilities, pupils, instructional programmes, school records, school premises, school quality, and the totality of the school system as well as education ministries and parastatals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Ensuring Efficiency and Preventing Wastage Educational efficiency is measured by the relationship between the inputs into the educational system and the outputs from the system. An educational system is said to be efficient if maximum output is obtained from minimum input. It is the duty of government to put appropriate measures in place to ensure that they get the best from the human and material resources invested on education. This can be by ensuring adequate teacher-pupil ratio, class size, lifespan of library books; adequate teachers workload, lifespan of lab-ware and consumables, etc. School consumables must also be closely monitored to avoid wastage.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>About nine per cent of Nigerias national budget is alloted to education. Do you consider this adequate?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. NETWORKING<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has the responsibility of aligning the country with international agencies and bodies. This will give room for the opportunity to compare educational programmes among countries, share ideas, and access opportunities available for the growth of the educational sector through educational aids. There are external aids from developed countries for development of educational programmes in developing countries of the world. Such aids could be in the form of supply of educational materials and equipment, training opportunities for teachers and administrators, professional services through the bilateral or multilateral relations among nations and others. Aids are also provided by private and non-governmental agencies. It is the duty of government to belong to and fulfil its obligations in relevant international bodies and agencies to avail the country of the opportunities that will enhance improvement and transformation in the countrys education sector. <\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>If all hands are on deck in partnering together, what could likely be the outcome of education in Nigeria?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Governments role in transforming education is germane.

Their roles cut across all aspects - from policy formulation to implementation. The success of a good educational system lies in proper appropriation of teachers roles. The impact of teachers has great effects on the educational system, either positively or negatively. Today, we shall examine some roles of teachers in transforming the education system of a nation.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p>Teachers roles in improving and transforming education in the country include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I. POLICIES, PROFESSIONALISM &amp; METHODOLOGY <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Implementation of Educational Policies:<\/strong> In order to have an improved and transformed education system in the country, there should be proper implementation of educational policies. Policies are made by the government but are carried out by the teachers. It is essential for teachers to study the national policy on education, understand it, and correctly interpret it in the classroom to ensure that the goals of the government for the nations education sector are achieved.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Professionalism in the Discharge of Duties:<\/strong> Teaching is what everyone is involved in - either directly or indirectly. Some people believe that teachers are born while others believe that teachers are made. The process of formal education requires that all who want to be involved in teaching as a career are trained. Teachers face different kinds of learners - those who are lazy, those who will not work unless they are motivated, the overzealous, the challenged and many others. If education will be effective and bring about transformation; teachers will have to discharge their duties with high level of professional competence. The principle and practice of education requires that a teacher be a master in his\/her field. Apart from subject mastery, teachers should have a right heart and attitude towards teaching. They must neither be lazy nor be found deficient in the discharge of their duties. Use of appropriate aids that will further facilitate learning is expected of a professional teacher. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Application of Appropriate Methods of Teaching:<\/strong> Learners are not usually interested in all that should be learnt. If they have their ways, they will select some topics that are of interest to them and reject other topics. Also, different learners learn at different paces, so for teaching to be effective, teachers need to employ different methods that suit the concept to be taught and at the same time, take care of the peculiarity of the learners. Some of the methods that may be used are: demonstration, play-way, discovery, dramatisation, etc. These will not only complement the traditional chalk board method, it will also make the teaching and learning process interesting and facilitate learning better.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>How can we commend the efforts of some teachers who are professional in their conduct?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. IN-SERVICE TRAINING, DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Connecting beyond Classroom:<\/strong> In order to improve and transform education, teachers must be ready to connect the classroom to the world outside the classroom. Many students do not always understand everything in the classroom. Some students prefer field experiences for better understanding of certain ideas. Excursions and field trips to banks, media houses, manufacturing companies, post office, government offices, farms and other places where what is taught in the classroom can be experienced by the learners will help their understanding.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. More Training:<\/strong> Knowledge is dynamic. For a teacher to stay relevant; he\/she must continue to update him\/herself through continuous learning. The day a person stops learning is the day he\/she starts to die. Staying on a spot for too long and not developing oneself will only make one stagnant, redundant, outdated and irrelevant. In order to improve and transform education, teachers should learn new things, especially in his or her field of studies, new methods of teaching, new discoveries about learners psychology, new teaching aids and other relevant tools necessary for productivity. The teacher who will improve and transform education must read books, attend seminars and workshops.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Maintenance of Discipline and Control in Schools:<\/strong> Teachers are to ensure that everyone in the school and particularly learners comply with rules and regulations laid down by the school authority. They are to ensure that learners do their home work promptly, avoid stealing and fighting in and outside the school, use waste bins and not litter the school premises, come to school early and not play truancy. They are to mediate in conflicts among learners without fear or favour.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>1. Why do some schools engage the services of unprofessional teachers?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Why do some parents refuse that their children be disciplined?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. SUPERVISION, MAINTENANCE AND SANITATION<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Supervision of Instructional Programmes<\/strong>: The premium given to supervision of instructional programmes in most areas of education administration is a reflection of its importance to effective management of teachers and pupils for the accomplishment of instructional goals and objectives. Supervision of instructional activities should not be limited to the teachers but be extended to the pupils. The principal must conduct regular random supervision of students attendance in class, classroom performance, quality and quantity of teaching.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Maintenance of School Facilities: <\/strong>The attitude of Nigerians to the use of public utilities is quite disturbing. Public materials are carelessly handled, managed and damaged subconsciously. The school administration should impress good maintenance education\/culture on the staff, students and school community. Damaging of school property should be frowned at and every individual should be made to take responsibility for replacement of any property he or she destroys. This, if well monitored, will be an evidence of true transformation in the education sector.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Environmental Sanitation: <\/strong>Cleanliness, they say, is next to godliness. The school environment should be kept clean and conducive for learning. The environment of the school must be child-friendly; pupils must be able to learn from what they see in their environment daily. This gives an orientation to the student. Teachers are responsible for ensuring that things are put in place for the maintenance and beautification of the school premises. When the school environment is green and neat, learning will be convenient, learners will be motivated to attend school and obviously, transformation is taking place.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>Let two class members share with the class; in turn, a remarkable experience of how a teacher influenced them towards positive living.<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>While Jesus was on earth, He was an exemplary Teacher of note who transformed His generation through His teachings.

Parents have the responsibility to enroll their children in school and see to it that they attend school regularly and punctually. They should do this by convincing the children about the importance of education and giving motivations as appropriate.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Childrens Basic Needs:<\/strong> Parents should not just put their children in schools; they should make provision for what they need to learn effectively. Provision of good food is basic. Also, they must ensure that what their children wear is neat, smart and comfortable for the child. Parents should also endeavour to make the home environment conducive for the children to live in. A neat, not congested, well-ventilated room, secured from mosquitoes and bad smell is good for children. Part of parents roles is the provision of textbooks, notebooks and other writing materials needed by the children. The atmosphere in the home must be that of love and peace. The provision of these essential needs will go a long way to help bring about the transformation of the countrys education.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Discuss the issue of commitment of parents of twenty years ago and parents of today to the education of their children.<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. PAYMENT OF SCHOOL FEES AND SUPERVISION OF THEIR CHILDREN <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Provide Some Level of Funding:<\/strong> It is not a hidden fact that qualitative education is costly. Most governments allow private participation in education in order to meet up with the enormous challenge it involves. Parents are required to support the efforts of government to fund education in any way possible. They may be required to pay some school fees or examination fees, P.T.A levies, development levies or some token for special projects that will be useful for the children. When parents cooperate with government in these and other ways, they are contributing to the improvement and transformation of education in the country. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Supervise School Activities through Their Children:<\/strong> Parents do not have to be in their childrens school to know what is going on there. They will be playing their role if they inquire about school activities from their children and make good use of useful information they get from them. Checking of classwork and assisting their children in their homework is a good way of supervising school activities. Parents should maturely channel their observations through appropriate quarters to the school with the mind of correcting and building up and not to terrorising the school or pulling it down.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>How would you counsel a mother whose child is always sent out of school for defaulting in fees but who will not fail to join her friends to buy clothes selected for social functions?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III.

Punctuality in School<\/strong>: The school system is about students and it is meant for them. To take students out of school is to ground the entire education process. Students are the raw materials to be processed and passed out as finished products. A very important role of students is to be available in school as and when they are expected to be there. It is a common saying that Punctuality is the soul of businesses. Punctuality of students to school is not just a means to an end but also an end in itself. When students form the habit of going early to school, they will do the same when they start to work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Positive Disposition to Learning:<\/strong> Students generally tend to learn when and what they wish to learn. A horse can be forced to the river but it cannot be forced to drink water from it. A vital role that students can play which can aid transformation of education in the country is to have a positive disposition to learning. They should desire to learn as prescribed by the system. Their earnestness and willingness will encourage teachers and bring about the realisation of the goals of planners of the curriculum.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Availability in Schools:<\/strong> The structure of the curriculum is such that school opens for a season of few weeks and then a break or holiday follows. According to the schools curriculum, each week has been assigned with lessons to be learnt. This makes it difficult for the lesson of a particular week to be carried over to another week. Thus it is very important for students to be regular in school to avoid missing out. Unless in emergency and for health reasons, all students are to attend school for the number of days school opens in a term. Ideally, when any student misses classes for about wo weeks out of the usual thirteen weeks school opens in a term, he or she should repeat the class. Truancy cannot help the students neither can it help the school programme. Therefore, students can promote transformation in the countrys education by being regular in school.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What can the school do to punish or correct students who are habitually late to school?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. COOPERATION AND PARTICIPATION <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Cooperation with School Academic Programmes:<\/strong> Apart from the need for students to be regular and punctual in school, they are to cooperate with the school programmes. This is to justify their reasons for going to school in the first place. They should attend classes, take lessons, participate in class work, do home work and other tasks that may be required by the teachers. This is another vital role that students can and should play to transform education in the country.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Active Participation in Student-oriented Activities:<\/strong> Learning is not restricted to the four walls of the classroom, it extends to outside the classroom and all students are to take part in them (cocurricular activities). Such activities include: debates, quiz competitions, games and sports, drama, music, club activities and the likes. Some students who may not be too good in academic work may be gifted in any of these other areas. Some people have ended up living on their talents, which they discovered during their school years. This is another way of bringing transformation to education in the country.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>How can the school handle students who refuse to cooperate with other students and teachers for learning activities?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. GO THE EXTRA MILE <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Go Ahead of Class:<\/strong> Students should be hard-working and exceptional in class. They are given access to the scheme to enable them work ahead of class work, especially during the holidays. Any student who does this will attract the interest and favour of the teacher. Such students make it possible for the class to meet up with the scheme within the stipulated time. The nations education system will make rapid progress as students form the habit of studying ahead of the class.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Research for Discoveries\/Inventions:<\/strong> Another very important transformational role that students can play in the countrys education is to venture into research work. They can do this either by assisting their teachers, conducting research as individuals or by teaming up in groups to carry out research work. Research work has the ability to produce results that can solve societal problems. This way, one can say that a nation has a transformed educational sector.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>Should students be involved in decision-making on what is to be taught in school?

THE GENESIS<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a broad sense, education starts the very moment a people form a community and begin to live together. Our fathers made implements for hunting, fishing, farming, building, etc. before the coming of the Whites. They had a system of administration and it was effective. It is therefore, correct to say that education in Nigeria predates the coming of the missionaries and colonial masters. However, the journey of the present-day modern education can be traced to the missionaries who brought the Gospel on one hand and education on the other. Notable among them are; Rev. Henry Townsend of the Anglican mission who came to Nigeria in 1842, Rev. Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodist denomination who came to Nigeria in 1846, Rev. Thomas J. Bowen of Baptist mission who came to Nigeria in 1850 and a host of others. The missionaries were the founders of CMS Grammar School, Lagos, which is the very first secondary school in Nigeria, founded in 1859. Islam opposed the spread of missionary activities to the north and that delayed the establishment of secondary schools in the region until 1922 when Katsina College was established followed by Kaduna College in 1938. Both schools were established by the colonial government. The pattern of post primary schools were: grammar or classical educational schools, teachers training, pastoral institutions, vocational and agricultural schools.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Let class members discuss the place of mission schools among other schools founded and managed by governments, communities and private individuals or groups in Nigeria today.<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p>II. THE GROWTH AND CHALLENGES As time went by, more schools were established by both Islamic and Christian missions, government, communities, private individuals and groups. Governments response to emerging challenges was tackled by formation of commissions like the Elliot commission of 1943, which recommended among other things, the establishment of a university college in Nigeria in 1948. The university college Ibadan was founded as an outpost of the university of London. The Banjo commission was set up by the Western region in 1960 while Ash commission was set up by the Federal government in 1960. Asabia commission of 1967 looked into the pay parity between the teachers in government schools and those in private schools. There was introduction of HSC to some secondary schools in 1951 and others in 1952. The first examination board, West African Examination Council (WAEC) was established with its headquarter in Accra, Ghana. In 1955, the Western Region government introduced free universal primary education and in 1957, the government of Eastern Region followed suit. From the first military coup and the civil war in 1967 to the return to civil rule in 1979, even till the present time, education in Nigeria has suffered serious set-backs. Some of the factors responsible are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> Unstable government and unstable policies;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> General economic meltdown;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Uncontrolled influx of the private sector participation in education;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Appointment of non-education specialists as ministers of education; as school administrators and as teachers;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> No pilot testing of programmes introduced to schools; - Embezzlement of school funds;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Obsolete curriculum;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Non-compliance to guiding rules and principles.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The consequences of these are many.

There are many awful situations which are calling for our help. As Christs disciples, we should not close our eyes to the needs of others. We should awake to the responsibility of having compassion for others when God brings them our way and care for them.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. COMPASSION <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term compassion has its linguistic root in the Latin terms com (with) and pati (suffering). Practically speaking, we have compassion when we set aside indifference and connect with those who are in pain. In a way, this seems to be the first step toward healing. When Jesus saw the blind men, He had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed Him. (Matthew 20:34) Oxford dictionary defined Compassion as a strong feeling of sympathy for somebody who is suffering while Webster dictionary describes compassion as feeling of wanting to help someone who is sick, hungry, in trouble, etc. It is also a sympathetic consciousness of others distress, with a desire to alleviate it. According to Vines Complete Expository Dictionary, compassion means to have mercy, to show kindness, by beneficence or assistance. Thus, compassion is having genuine concern for the suffering, need and problem of another person and making a concrete effort to meet the need or ameliorate the problem. It is a heartfelt feeling that generates a response to other persons predicament without expecting a reward or favour in return. It is giving of assistance, mercy, kindness to the needy. The Bible records how Christ had compassion on crowds of people and individuals (Matthew 9:36; 14:14; 15:32; 18:27; 20:34; Mark 1:41; 6:34; 8:2; 9:22). To sum it up, compassion means someone elses heartbreak becoming your heartbreak. Anothers suffering becoming your suffering.

The Practice of Compassion Compassion is Gods nature and should be the nature of every believer. The more believers become sensitive to the voice of the Holy Spirit, the more compassionate they become. As believers, we should be cautious of the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Do away with prejudice and passing judgment on persons passing through suffering.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit while rendering compassionate acts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Do not allow condemnation in your heart, if the compassionate act is misinterpreted, taken for granted or not appreciated by the receiver when your best has been offered. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.(Romans 14:22)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Be prudent in showing kindness Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your father in heaven. (Matthew 6:1)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Do not be gullible. Some request for their compassionate acts just to milk others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>True compassion is a result of a life devoted to God and His will. The trials and tribulations we face daily are meant to give us strength and be sources of blessing to others. Because we have been through it, we can be of help to lead others through too. Showing compassion will also help us to be more confident in God, His work within and through us.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Have you ever been defrauded by a fellow who took advantage of your compassionate act?

Putting Compassion into Action(Matthew 25:34-36, 40)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The life of Jesus Christ is the greatest example of true compassion. Not only did Jesus have compassion and heal many people from their physical suffering, He also showed the greatest compassion for humankind when He died on the cross for our sins. It is not always easy to show compassion, especially when we feel the person in need of our compassionate act deserves misfortune. The Bible in the book of Matthew 25:34-36, teaches us that showing compassion is a true test of Christian character. Another great example of a compassionate act is how the father of the prodigal son showed compassion on him (Luke 15:11-32). A Jewish lawyer, in an attempt to justify himself jested: Who is my neighbour? Jesus replied by telling the parable of the travelling Samaritan who encountered a wounded Jew. The hero of the story was the despised Samaritan who was moved with compassion against his enemy and helped him (Luke 10:33). As believers, God has called us from darkness into light so that we can be of help to the people of the world. A heart immersed in compassion will overcome superficial barriers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christ also incorporated the concept of compassion into His teachings, thereby conveying some comforting and powerful truths.

The world is governed by laws and principles. There are natural laws that must be obeyed. And more importantly, the kingdom of God is governed by laws and principles too.

Understanding Obedience<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the Greek terms for obedience conveys the idea of positioning oneself under someone by submitting to his authority and command. Another Greek word for obedience in the New Testament means &quot;trust.&quot; According to Holmans Illustrated Bible Dictionary, a succinct definition of biblical obedience is &quot;to hear Gods Word and act accordingly.&quot; Eerdmans Bible Dictionary says, &quot;True hearing, or obedience, involves the physical hearing that inspires the hearer and a belief or trust that in turn motivates the hearer to act in accordance with the speakers desires.&quot; So, biblical obedience to God simply means, to hear, trust, submit and surrender to God and His Word. The concept of obedience both in the Old and New Testaments relate to hearkening to a higher authority. The ultimate source of instructions, rules, laws, and guidelines is the almighty God, and He must be obeyed. His laws are eternal as Himself. To obey or disobey His laws has results. God gives humankind His instruction through different ways.

There are many people who were once great men but were brought down from the height of success to the valley of abject failure because humility is lacking in them. Hard work, talents, skills, education, and connection can bring a person to lime light, but humility keeps a man on success track.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Humility <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humility is the ability to be without pride or arrogance. It is an important virtue a follower of Christ must imbibe. Again, Jesus is our perfect example. He humbly followed Gods plan for His life. The Bible presents God as One who resists the proud and gives grace to the humble (1 Peter 5:6). The picture of humility in the Bible reveals putting others first, as against self-centredness (Philippians 2:3). Humility is being comfortable with who you are in the Lord and putting others first. Humility also is recognizing that you need Gods help, knowing you cannot succeed by your own strength. It is thanking God for your talents and gifts, and giving Him credit for your accomplishments. It is gratefully walking in Gods grace, love and forgiveness. The book of Proverbs contains a lot of warnings for those who refuse to be humble. The New Testament also contains blessings for those who put others before themselves. As Christs disciples, we will miss out these numerous blessings prepared by God for the humble if we fail to get rid of pride and humbly follow His purpose for our lives.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Is it possible for a believer to know if he or she is humble?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Humility in Action <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Abraham:<\/strong> In the book of Genesis chapter 13, Abraham displayed humility when problem arose between him and his nephew (Lot). Abraham humbly allowed Lot to choose his land first before he did. This is different from what operates in our contemporary society where an elder selects before the younger.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moses:<\/strong> The Bible records that the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth. (Numbers 12:3) Moses humbly allowed God to use him to save His people Israel. He risked his life for Israel not to be consumed. He reminded God of His promise to Abraham that his seed will inherit the land He promised. Because of Moses, Israel was not consumed; the Lord relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened. (Exodus 32:13-14).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jesus Christ: <\/strong>The life of Jesus Christ is the best example of humility in action. Although He was the son of God, He was gentle and humble (Matthew 11:29). There is no greater example of humility in the entire Bible than it is found in Jesus Christ (Philippians 2:3-4). He took the form of a servant by washing the feet of the disciples. Jesus gave up His glory in heaven to live among sinners. He left His throne where God rules and willingly gave His life as a ransom for many (Mark 10:45). He loved us so much that He died for us. He endured the shame, ridicule, scorn, torture, and an agonising death on the cross.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Epaphroditus:<\/strong> He was almost killed for the sake of the Gospel. Epaphroditus was in prison with Paul for some time, but regardless of what it was, Epaphroditus poured his life into helping Paul and the church (Philippians 2:24-27). He literally risked his life to be Pauls servant and right-hand man. He esteemed Pauls life better than his own and his own life as expendable for the Gospels sake. That is a very profound sign of humility.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Paul<\/strong>: Pauls humility was well-portrayed in the Book of Philippians. He was among the brightest of the Jewish religious group; a Pharisee regarding the law or an expert in the law, a Hebrew and from the tribe of Benjamin (Philippians 3:5). He was on his way to persecute believers before his Damascus Road experience (Philippians 3:6-8; Acts 9). Paul demonstrated humility by referring to himself as the least of the apostles (1 Corinthians 15:9), and the chief of all sinners (1 Timothy 1:15).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Mention some women in the Bible that lived a life of humility.<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III.

Some view gentleness as weakness, but this is far from the truth. Gentleness is a spiritual gift. It is listed among the nine fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23. Compassion, obedience and humility are not directly listed in the Bible as fruit of the Holy Spirit, but these virtues are a must for followers of Christ because Christ exemplified them.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Understanding the Word Gentleness:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gentleness can be defined as moral excellence in a persons appearance and behaviour. Gentleness is a state of being honest, true, and fair in the total outward look and behaviour. Gentleness is revealed through physical appearance and behaviour. It is a tender, compassionate approach toward others weaknesses and limitations. A gentle person speaks the truth at all times, and in doing so, guards his tongue so that the truth can be well received. The Bible tells of Jesus gentleness. In fact, the Old Testament depicts the Messiah as gentle, telling us that Jesus would not break a &quot;bruised reed&quot; or snuff out a &quot;smoldering wick&quot; (Isaiah 42:3). In the Gospels, Jesus affirmed His gentleness: &quot;I am gentle and humble in heart.&quot; (Matthew 11:29) And the apostles often reminded the early church of Jesus gentleness: &quot;By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you.&quot; (2 Corinthians 10:1) This reveals that disciples of Christ are distinguished by gentleness.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Can you describe yourself as being gentle in the light of this definition and mention some acts of gentleness?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II.

The Holy Spirit enables a believer to be meek and gentle in words and deeds. As Paul revealed in his letter to the Galatians, he expressed that the Holy Spirit produces the fruit we have in the book of Galatians 5:22-23: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Gentleness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. It is the fruit of repentance. To &quot;repent&quot; in a biblical sense is to change ones wrong attitude and believe that God is right. Repentance is necessary for salvation. Repentance is done with a gentle spirit. A gentle heart will accept Gods wisdom and yield to His discernment.

How Can We Demonstrate Gentleness?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gentleness is typically regarded as something that is weak, mild or non-assertive. It is a result (fruit) of the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Being gentle requires self-control, and thoughtfulness. Modern examples of gentleness are distinctly uncommon. How can we remain gentle considering the unsympathetic, cruel and angry world we live in?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. We should learn to tender an apology whenever there is emotional outburst between us and others. We are human beings with different levels of emotions or temperaments. We should realise that our actions could affect others negatively. When such happens, there could be a negative reaction. We should apologise, seek to make amends and control self to prevent such outbursts in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. We should always remember Gods gentleness in dealing with us. The fact remains that we will not always be at the receiving end, but when we remember how God has been so gentle with us even when we refuse to do His will, we will do likewise.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. We must always ponder on Gods Word and determine to obey what it says. This will enable us see our weaknesses and seek grace to live gentle lives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being gentle does not mean that we should not be strong in our beliefs, it does imply that we should be wise and loving in expressing our beliefs to others.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>Is it right for a Christian not to rebuke evil or wickedness in the society?

Gentleness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit that places our strength under Gods guidance. Gentleness makes us to correct others with love instead of arguing in resentment and anger (Galatians 6:1). Being gentle does not mean to overlook sinful acts of people instead of correcting them. It implies confronting a sinner in love such that such a sinner will realise his\/her sins and repent of them. Gentleness is not a weakness. It is strength of character that matches the life of Christ.

As disciples of Christ, we are expected to emulate this love in our relationship with others and most especially, members of our family. Our characters, habits and actions must not be different from that of the Master. No wonder, at Antioch, the people saw the disciples and affirmed that everything about them resembled Christ and called them Christians, which means &quot;little Christ&quot;. Throughout the ministry of Jesus on earth, He showered unconditional love on people and above all, He died for our sin. In like manner, the disciples allowed Jesus to pour Himself into them and so they were able to reflect His virtues.

It is also called agape love. An unconditional love is a sacrificial love. It is the kind of love that Jesus showered on us by leaving His glory in heaven to come to the earth and die for the sins of humankind. It is love that does not request anything in return. It is an unfailing love. This love is described in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7: Love is patient and kind, is not jealous or boastful, not arrogant or rude, does not insist on its own way, it is not irritable or resentful, it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoice at right, it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Why is it that today unconditional love is scarce between husband and wife, and between parents and their children?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II.

David and Jonathan:<\/strong> Unconditional love existed between David and Jonathan to the extent that Jonathan did all he could to save Davids life when king Saul, his father sought to kill him.

The four of them moved to the land of Moab because of famine that prevailed in the land. While in the land, the two sons got married. One married Ruth and the other Orpah. In Moab, Elimelech and their two sons died. So Naomi decided to return to the land of Bethlehem. She told Ruth and Orpah to return to their people since she had no sons that could marry them. After much persuasion, Orpah returned to her people but Ruth purposed to go with her mother-in-law all the way. Ruth said to Naomi: Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God; where you die, I will die and there will I be buried.

In a family relationship, every member of the family must lovingly ensure smooth and cordial relationship and be ready to tolerate the character, nature and situation of one another, thereby promoting peace, love and harmony (agreement). Understanding is very important in the home if the home must thrive. A family is a social unit of the society. For every member of the society to enjoy harmony, there is need for a level of understanding because understanding brings respect and peace.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Significance of Understanding in Relation to Family Harmony<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For family harmony to be strong, understanding of each member of the family is necessary. Husband and wife must understand each other; parents must understand their children and vice versa. Where understanding is lacking, family harmony will be lost. In a family where understanding is lacking, the husband will be cautioning the children about certain things but the wife will not see anything wrong with it and vice-versa, this can be a hindrance to family harmony. The home will be in shambles if not shattered or scattered and it will be endured instead of being enjoyed. In the home, both husband and wife need to know that the two of them are to ensure the training of their children. The Bible says: Train up a child in a way he should go, when he is old, he will not depart from it (Proverbs. 22:6). Thus, it is the responsibility of both parents to unanimously train their children. The training of children should not be one sided and this calls for genuine understanding between parents. When there is understanding between husband and wife, problems in the home are easily solved. Understanding gives room for the Spirit of God to flow in the home. In addition, it gives room for respect, peace, contentment and love to thrive. Understanding paves way for progress, growth and development. It also allows divine peace to reign. Where understanding is absent, there will be delay in progress, growth and development.

In Brian Klemmers excellent book, The Compassionate Samurai, he explained why we should learn to trust others in spite of our fears. He reiterated that taking the risk of trusting others can yield more benefits than disadvantages.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. The Concept of Trust Explained <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust is a firm belief in the integrity, ability, or character of a person or thing. It can also mean confidence or reliance. It involves having confidence in another person by believing whatever the person says. Furthermore, trust could be seen as the condition and resulting obligation of having confidence placed in one. Trust means committing something into the care of another. In marriage, couples commit their lives to each other. They rely on each other for the future. The importance of trust cannot be ruled out in the family. It is one of the ingredients needed for a family to be exemplary. Trust brings patience, peace, joy, reliability, confidence and worth among members of the family. The absence of trust brings about complaints, frustration, nagging, murmuring, suspicions, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust, faith, confidence, and reliance are synonyms denoting a feeling of certainty that a person or thing will not fail. The opinion of the Christian couple should be that trust must always be found between them and among members of their family.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust is known as the trait of believing in the honesty and reliability of others. It is also known as a complete confidence in a person or plan. It is also referred to as something (as property) held by one party (the trustee) for the benefit of another (the beneficiary). It reflects a reliable relationship. When there is no trust, suspicion sets in. When this happens, the home will be affected. Trust as one of the ingredients of blissful marriage is very crucial. It is needful because it makes the family relationship strong and united.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a home where trust is lacking, unity cannot exist. Trust is one of the pillars that sustain the family. Trust brings peace of mind anytime, anywhere, any day. In a family where trust is displaced on the platter of unfaithfulness, it would not be long that suspicions, deceits and complaints will set in. For a family to be what it should and to enjoy family harmony, trust must be put in place. If trust fades away in the family, it means the society is not safe because the family is an important part of the society. Many homes have experienced problem, trouble, catastrophe, divorce, stagnancy, retrogression, etc. due to lack of trust.

Benefits of Trust for Family Harmony <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> We are social beings, therefore, we cannot live in isolation. There will always be need for us to relate with one another. For good and cordial relationship, we therefore need to trust others. Brian Klemmer has helped to identify five benefits that are derived from trusting others. It could be applied in the family as well:<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Trusting others is the only way to access the synergistic power of teamwork\/partnership in the family.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Trusting others builds relationship and intimacy.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Trusting others paves way for time, freedom, and efficiency in the home.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Trusting others is the primary tool for making a difference and being of service to others or one another in the family.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Trusting others provides you with a feeling of exhilaration or excitement.

If in Christian families, Christian women cannot be trusted then it is not an exaggeration to say that there is fire on the roof top of such homes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Christian family, the issue of trust must be genuine and real. There should be trust between the husband and the wife and between parents and their children if the home would be what it should be and fulfill its purpose. If the husband says he is going to Lagos, he should not be found going to Jos.

It is the process by which information is transmitted between people and thus a vehicle for the exchange of thoughts, ideas and feelings. It is one of the important tools by which character is moulded and attitude influenced. It is a means through which affection is expressed in relationships. The content of communication in the family is essentially thoughts, emotions and affections. This is done by verbal or non-verbal means. A renowned researcher of non - verbal communication, Mehrabian (1981) stated that in Communicating feelings and attitudes:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> 7% of the message is communicated through spoken words.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> 38% is communicated through body language and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>55% is communicated through facial expression It is therefore important to note that since 93% means of communicating feelings and attitudes is non- verbal, great attention should be given to body language, facial expression and voice tone in family communication.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is therefore important to note that since 93% means of communicating feelings and attitudes is non- verbal, great attention should be given to body language, facial expression and voice tone in family communication.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Read James 1:19 and list some things men and women could do to improve on communication in their families?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Vital Functions and Elements of Good Communication<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three main vital functions of communication in the family namely:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Bonding of Family Members:<\/strong> Effective communication enables couples and their children to know the physical and emotional needs of each other and also understand and predict each others feelings and attitudes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Socialisation of Children:<\/strong> (Proverbs 22:6). The family is the childs first school and parents are his\/her first teachers. The interpretation, response and management of feelings, emotions,and affections are first taught at home. Thus, the child is socialised into the world through family communication.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Establishing Family Tradition, Legacy and Identity:<\/strong> (Philippians 4:8). As couples get bonded and children socialised through effective communication, the family begins to develop a common attitude which when further strengthened and enforced becomes the familys tradition, legacy or identity. What a family is known for is the idea or attitude that is consistently communicated to successive generations. In addition, elements of good communication include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Standing for the truth (Ephesians 4:15)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Sincere expression of love for one another in the home (1 Corinthians 18:4 - 8a).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.

Critical steps in Building Effective Communication <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. The readiness to make necessary sacrifice:<\/strong> It is essential for individual members of a family to create time for family interaction. Husband and wife must strive to be available and not appear to be too busy to attend to family issues. When necessary, we should switch off phones, television, and radio so as to have quality time with our family. We should be more concerned about the interest of other family members than ours (Philippians 2:3-4).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. The ability to communicate frequently and freely:<\/strong> When we fail to communicate, we allow family members to assume things and speculate how we feel and what our thoughts are. When they assume wrongly and act, we are likely to be offended. Vocalizing our thoughts and feelings is a key to enabling family members understand us. Better family harmony is achieved when feelings and expectations are known by members. Do not assume that your family members know how much you love them, this must be expressed through communication.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. The sensibility to create conducive atmosphere:<\/strong> Family communication is not a tool to impose will, dish out instructions and commands, nor say despicable things. It is rather a tool for communion - exchange of thoughts and feelings. Fathers and mothers should be approachable. Fathers and mothers are to break the walls around them and allow free access to discuss all issues.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. The care to pay close attention:<\/strong> Research has shown that 93% of thoughts and feelings are communicated through non-verbal means. Therefore, paying close attention to voice tone, body language, and facial expression will help to understand what is actually being conveyed. On some occasions, what is said may differ from what is intended.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. The skill to listen with your heart:<\/strong> A very vital aspect of communication is listening. To listen with your heart is to make the best possible effort to understand the other persons view point. This will require listening actively by seeking clarification and by intermittently asking really? or did I get you right? Show interest and concern as you occasionally say I understand. Another requirement for effective listening is to listen intently and patiently When a family member runs to you to communicate, he\/she seeks your love, interest, help, and empathy at that point in time. By all means, offer the desired concern and be patient.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>f. The grace to build and maintain trust:<\/strong> Family members are more willing to communicate their thoughts and feelings freely and honestly with those whom they believe their confidentialities are safe. People also feel safe with those who are genuinely concerned about their wellbeing. Always seek the consent of the person concerned before discussing information entrusted to you with a third party. For instance, after a heart to heart talk with your child you may simply ask, May I discuss it with your mum or dad?<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time4":"<p>1.

The reason must have been because they were with Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace. When Paul was mentioning the fruit of the Spirit, in his list, he did not forget to add peace. This shows how indispensable peace is in human interactions. In the Bible, the psalmist says, Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it (Psalm 34:14). Peter also says in 1 Peter 3:11: They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it. Seeking and pursuing peace is expected to be the aim of every believer in Christ. To have a good relationship that is rightly placed, the reality of peace cannot be avoided. Peace must be between couples (husband and wife), between parents and their children (members of the family) for the sake of family harmony. Peace was obvious among the disciples. This reveals the type of persons they were and the relationship they had with their Master. The peace amidst them was so real, perhaps this made their fellowship a strong one.

Since Christ is the Prince of Peace, every family or home whose foundation is Jesus Christ is expected to experience and enjoy peace and harmony. When Christ is in the family, there is no doubt that such family will enjoy peace. Peace is known as a state of absolute quietness or calmness with oneself and people around. When there is peace in a family, people would want to associate with the individuals in such family. But when a family is experiencing chaos, people would not want to associate with individuals in such family and if they do, they will likely be birds of the same feather. When Jesus was on earth, He was known to be peaceful and many people were always with Him to learn from Him. As a true disciple of Christ, peace must be given its rightful position to reign in your home. We must represent Christ anywhere we go and make peace with all men.

Where there is no peace, there would be problem and chaos everywhere. The family is a unique integral part of the society and every society begins with the family. When there is no peace in families, there would be problem, trouble, catastrophe, divorce, stagnancy, retrogression, etc. in the society. Peace is an ingredient that must be present in the home at all times for family harmony to thrive. Where this is lacking, ill-feeling, nagging, murmuring, complaint, uproar, confusion, commotion, tumult, boycott, etc., will not be far from the family thereby causing disharmony.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Why is it that some families are not experiencing peace?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>The importance of peace cannot be overstressed for a family to enjoy harmonious living.

Some understand ministry as the responsibility belonging to pastors only, some see it as a collective service of both pastors and members, while some others believe that ministry is a money making venture. The truth remains that Ministry is service and every believer in Christ is a minister. There are different dimensions to ministry. Adequate knowledge about ministry is therefore the catalyst to developing the right attitude towards ministry<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Truths about Ministry:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word ministry is a broad term which does not have a single definition, however, W.W. Warren and David Wiersbe gives us a clue into the truths about ministry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Service is the Nature of Ministry: <\/strong>Ministry is service, not about exercising authority. Jesus told His disciples, for even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve... (Mark 10:45). Ministry calls for doing the work of a servant just as Jesus Christ our Master did.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Character is the Foundation of Ministry:<\/strong> When good character\/integrity is displayed in the life of a believer, his\/her ministry will blossom. Good character\/integrity sustains ministry and through it, lives are blessed. King Solomon said the integrity of the upright guides them... (Proverbs 11:3; NIV). With excellent character in ministry, success is certain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Gods Glory is the Purpose of Ministry:<\/strong> Ministry demands that whatever services a believer renders either within the four walls of the church or outside, God takes the glory. Thus, no one should ascribe glory to himself but all glory should be to the Master who granted the privilege and ability to serve. God declares ... I will not yield my glory to another (Isaiah 48:11).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Jesus Christ is the Model of Ministry:<\/strong> The life of Jesus Christ is an example to follow. While He was on earth, He was busy doing the work of the ministry. He healed the sick, raised the dead, provided for the needy, performed miracles, preached and taught Gods word. Above all, He gave His life as a ransom for our sins. As Christs disciples, we are to follow His example.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. Love is the Motive for Ministry:<\/strong> Whatever we do in ministry should be motivated by our sincere love for God and others. Our work of ministry should not be motivated by our selfish desires.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>f. Sacrifice is the Measure for Ministry:<\/strong> Ministry requires sacrifice of our time, energy, convenience and substance (money and other material possessions). Jesus Christ sacrificed His own life as a ransom for all. We must therefore follow in His footsteps (Mark10:45b).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>g. Submission is the Authority of Ministry:<\/strong> Ministry demands that we submit ourselves completely to the Master for instructions. Doing it in our own way, using our human wisdom, will only lead to failure. Absolute obedience and total submission to God is the only authority that we have in ministry. This is why King Solomon admonished, trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight (Proverbs 3:5-6).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>h. Prayer and Scripture are the Tools for Ministry:<\/strong> These two are very crucial for success in ministry. A disciple must be diligent in prayer and study of the Word of God. These are necessary to overcome the challenges of ministry. Paul exhorts us in Ephesians 6:10-11, to be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power, putting on the full armour of God which includes prayer and the Word of God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I. Growth is the Privilege of Ministry:<\/strong> Ministry gives the privilege to grow to maturity. A believer who involves himself\/herself in ministry work has good opportunity to grow. He\/she cannot be stagnant because as he\/she blesses others through ministry, blessings (both spiritual and physical) will continue to flow into his\/her life too. Also, there will be spiritual and physical growth in the body of Christ.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>j. The Holy Spirit is the Power of Ministry:<\/strong> The power of the Holy Spirit makes ministry to thrive. Zechariah says not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord Almighty (4:6, NIV). Without the power of the Holy Spirit, the works of ministry will be fruitless.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What is your understanding of ministry from the biblical perspective?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Different Areas of Ministry<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the church setting, all ministry areas function in unity of purpose for edifying the body of Christ. They all work together to fulfil the Great Commission, depopulating Satans kingdom and expanding Gods kingdom on earth. For example: the church education ministry comprises the Sunday school, discipleship training, literacy ministry, stewardship education, and family life education. Other ministries which feature in our churches are the music, ushering, counselling, drama, prayer, visitation, social, publicity and media. Every church member is expected to fit in and be able to serve in at least one of these ministries. Every believer in Christ has been called out of darkness into Gods marvellous light to show forth the praise of God who called them (1 Peter 2:9). Thus, believers are to<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) bring forth godly characters (fruit of the Holy Spirit) and<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) serve God according to the measure of grace (spiritual gifts) that has been bestowed upon each one. No true disciple of Christ should say there is nothing he\/she can do to make the body of Christ grow. We must all be ready to do our best through active service in ministry to contribute to the edification of the body of Christ.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>What is the difference between the spiritual gifts and positional responsibility in church ministries?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Tools for Ministry (Spiritual Gifts) <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is God who calls us to service and equips us with necessary tools for the work. Every believer in Christ has been endowed with spiritual gift(s) for the work of ministry according to the measure of his\/her faith. God accomplishes His redemptive purpose in the life of a believer through the giving of spiritual gifts in diversity. Thus, the Trinity works together in the life of every believer and for the maturing of the body of Christ. The Son teaches us to minister; the Holy Spirit gives the gifts needed for ministry while the Father works in us and through us. It is very important for us as Christs disciples to discover and develop our spiritual gifts so that we can identify the ministry which we fit in properly. A believer who has discovered his\/her spiritual gifts and utilizes them diligently will play a very vital role in ministering to other people and leading them to maturity (Ephesians 4:12-16). However, failure to discover our spiritual gifts and develop them will amount to depriving other believers of the blessings they should enjoy from our unique ministry. Another truth about spiritual gifts is that God gives them to believers to glorify Himself. When spiritual gifts are used according to the leading of the Holy Spirit together with the fruit of the Spirit (love), and in total obedience to God, He is glorified. Also, when believers discover their spiritual gifts and develop them, they will enjoy the benefits of knowing and being sure of Gods will at every point in time. They will be able to make intelligent decisions about certain things as they continue in lifes journey.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are fifteen spiritual gifts as highlighted by Paul in 1Corinthians 12:1-11; Romans 12:6-8 and Ephesians 4:11-13. They include: message of wisdom, message of knowledge, faith, gift of healing, miraculous powers, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, speaking in diverse tongues, interpretation of tongues, serving, teaching, encouraging, giving (generosity), leadership, showing mercy. These gifts are meant to fulfil the ministries of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. When a believer fails to use his\/her gifts, the gifts will decline and fade away and such a believer will have to account for them before God on the last day.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>What is the difference between spiritual gifts and natural talents?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Adequate understanding of what ministry is all about is very crucial.God is the owner of ministry.

No one is called to be a spectator, an onlooker, or benchwarmer.

What God is only interested in (and will reward) is obedience. We need to understand Gods purpose and operate in the unique ministry to which we have been called. Some Christians believe that they lack the ability to minister. They think God has prepared some people specifically for the task. Other Christians who have the desire to do Gods work do not know how or where to start. In the Old Testament, only a very few people such as the priests, had access to God during the sacrificial process. In the New Testament however, every believer is called to do the work of the ministry (1 Peter 2:9). Thus, any concept or structure of the church that does not uphold the priesthood of all believers is fundamentally unbiblical and does not bring honour to the Lord.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. All Christians are Called to Serve<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every Christian is called to Gods service. We all have something to contribute to Christianity and her expansion. We must understand that our service has eternal value. Just like the woman who gave the last two coins she had was praised by Jesus, we must be ready to give our all for the work of the Master. The power of the Holy Spirit is there to help us hear and speak with God about what He wants us to do. God has also endowed us with ability to serve Him and humankind. The Bible tells us that Jesus gave ministries to the Church to prepare Christians for works of service (Ephesians 4:12). One of the mandates of Christian leadership is to equip believers for works of service by identifying gifts and callings, training people and supporting them with necessary tools. These multiply the effectiveness of Christian witness and promotes healthy church growth. When leaders teach Gods Word with insight and accuracy, they contribute to the growth of Christians from spiritual childhood to maturity. When our focus as Christian workers is on Jesus, our service to the world would be impactful.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"","interaction2":"<p><strong>II.

Consequently, as a member of Gods body, we must be equipped and motivated for ministry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Each Believer is Gifted by the Spirit:<\/strong> God, through the Holy Spirit has given us gifts for works of ministry (1 Corinthians 12:7-11). As believers, we should seek to discover the gifts and develop them for works of ministry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Each Believer has a Function in the Family of God:<\/strong> Since God loves us and has given us gifts, it is clear, then, that each believer has a specific role to perform in the body of Christ. It is not our idea to come to faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:4-5, 11). It is not our decision that determines what gift the Holy Spirit would give us (1 Corinthians 12:11). It is God who determines it. Each believer has a vital God-ordained role to play. God has determined that the church should function this way. Thus, to be a part of the family of believers and yet have no role to play is impossible.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Mention some other facts that show every Christian is a minister?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Not Spectator but a Minister<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>God has called us to service and to represent Him before humankind. We are the Church that God wants to use and not the physical building. Our lives should be such that will attract others to Him in the neighbourhood, at our workplace, or at school. Our life matters in ministering to other people as it is often said that action speaks louder than words. God has given each of us the privilege of telling people about Christ. We may not be called as full-time Christian workers, but we are called to share Gods lifechanging, transforming power with our world (Acts 1:8). We should not be spectators but ministers of God. Having paid staff or trained professionals in the local church is not bad, but there are pitfalls in paying people for the work of the ministry. It is expected of believers to contribute their part to service in Gods vineyard. Believers are not expected to be so particular about financial reward for serving in the church. We must understand that it is God who rewards the labour of His children. It takes time to equip members for the work of ministry and that is why sometimes some people are paid for their service within or outside the body of Christ. By paying them, they are being used and their services are accounted for. However, the local church must ensure that the structure of the church encourages each member of the body to do the works of ministry.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>What is the purpose of Gods call on every believer?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"<p><strong>IV. Ways Every Christian should Minister<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets consider some ways through which every Christian should minister.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Every Christian should show hospitality to others (Romans. 12:13).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Every Christian should witness Christ to all (Acts 1:8).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Every Christian should make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Every Christian should minister to the sick.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Every Christian should minister to erring Christians (Galatians 6:1; James 5:19, 20).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Every Christian should help the needy (James 2:14-17; 1 Jn. 3:17, 18).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Every Christian should pray for others including their enemies (1 Samuel 12:23).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Every Christian should comfort the bereaved (Romans 12:15; Galatians 6:2).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Every Christian should encourage the broken hearted.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>V. The Necessity of Equipping Believers <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Christians are to be equipped for the work of ministry. The church is responsible for equipping her members. Ministry is Christs own programme of service to the world, which He entrusts to all believers, not only to a group of clergy, diaconate, or nominated officers within the church alone. It is meant for all Gods people. The New Testament does not elevate a certain class of Christians to be saints, nor designate certain individuals as saints; all believers are saints. Paul uses the term in this way, as is evident from the way he addresses the believers wherever he went (Romans 1:7, Ephesians 1:1, Philippians 4:21-22). Everyone in the body of Christ is to be equipped. The term equipping thus suggests preparation, training and discipline necessary to enable believers do the work of ministry. Everyone should be built up in Christ unto maturity.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time4":"<p>In what ways can the church equip her members for ministry?<\/p>\r\n","closing_remark":"<p>Any Christian denomination that stresses hierarchy at the expense of ministry practices mediocrity. Relevant church life involves every man, woman, young and old in doing what God has called him or her to do. Everyone has been endowed with a gift from the Holy Spirit but not all can be preachers or leaders. God has called some people to be good administrators, counselors or encouragers. Others have the gift of financial accounting. Everyone is expected to use his\/her gift for Gods work.

In the bid to fight back, satanic forces brings about ministry challenges of diverse kinds. As Christs disciples, we need to prepare ourselves ahead of these challenges since it is certain that challenges will come.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Definition and Types of Ministry Challenges Ministry<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenges are unpalatable situations or problems which manifest in the course of fulfilling our God-given mandate, the Great Commission. They are so numerous that we cannot discuss them all. Also, ministry challenges could be physical or spiritual.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A. Physical Challenges include: <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Poor Leadership\/Lack of Committed Leaders:<\/strong> Some people enter into ministry not because they love God or the people, but because they want fame, respect, recognition and even money. As a result, they lose focus of the ministry they have been called into to pursue worldly things.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Lack of Trained Workers:<\/strong> In some churches, workers are not trained in their ministry areas. As a result, they do not know how to go about the work assigned to them. They do it the way they can and not necessarily the way it should be done. For example, when Sunday school teachers or ushers are not trained, their works of ministry will be ineffective.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Opposition\/Persecution from Church Members<\/strong>: Opposition\/persecution sometimes arises from the congregation either against the church pastor, a departmental leader or a worker. This opposition could result from envy, jealousy, strife, selfish ambition and so on and result in crisis in the church.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Relationship Problem<\/strong>: Where sincere love is missing in a local church, relationship problem will certainly arise. People will find it difficult to forgive one another and the congregation will be filled with gossipers. When this happens, the ministry of the church will be greatly affected.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. Lack of Fund to Cater for the Needs of the Ministry:<\/strong> Ministry requires a lot of money to fund its activities such as mission and evangelism, training of workers, payment of full-time staff, buying and maintenance of church equipment, purchase of education literatures and so on. Lack of fund is a serious ministry challenge because it makes the ministry suffer set back.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B. Spiritual Challenges<\/strong>: Spiritual challenges are mainly demonic activities in the church. These activities may manifest in different forms. Examples are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Sins<\/strong> such as fornication, adultery, fraudulent activities indulged in by leaders, workers and other church members.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Attacks<\/strong> like sickness, sudden death, accident of different kinds, late marriage among the youth, bareness among couples and so on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Cold attitude of members to spiritual things<\/strong> such as low attendance at mid-week worship sessions like Bible study, prayer meetings and other spiritual enriching programmes of the church.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Lack of spiritual growth of members.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Mention the likely causes of ministry challenges.<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Some Bible Characters who faced Ministry Challenges<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some Bible characters also faced certain challenges in the course of discharging their ministry duties. In the Old Testament, Moses, David and Jeremiah are good examples to examine, while in the New Testament, Jesus, the disciples, and Paul are examples. The challenges they faced are as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Moses:<\/strong> Moses, while leading the Israelites out of Egypt through the wilderness was confronted with various challenges such as blames and complaints from the Israelites at the Red Sea (Exodus 15:10-14), Marah experience (Exodus 15:22-25), lack of food for the Israelites at the wilderness of sin (Exodus 16:2-3), lack of water at Rephidim (Exodus17:2-6). Also Moses faced the Amalekites attack at Rephidim but God intervened when Moses, Aaron and Hur held up the staff of God at the hill top (17:8-14). He faced the challenge of disobedient followers and a weak associate (Aaron) who could not hold forth for him while he was away by making a golden calf for them to worship (Exodus 32:1-6). He faced the rebellion of the Israelites at Taberah over lack of meat, cucumber, melon, onions, leeks and garlic (Numbers 11:1-6). Lastly is the challenge of jealousy, criticism and opposition from his sister Miriam and his brother, Aaron for marrying a Cushite lady (Numbers 12:1-15). But despite all these challenges, Moses looked up to God who called him and God harkened to him.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. David:<\/strong> Though David was a king, he faced a lot of challenges while leading as the king of Judah and when he became king over all the Israelites. After Sauls death, the remaining tribes of Israel did not accept him as their leader. Their rebellion was led by Abner, the chief commander of Sauls army who proclaimed Ishbosheth, Sauls son as king over Israel. Although David sought for the support of the men of Jabesh-gilead, they did not yield to his plea (2 Samuel 2:1-11). On another occasion, David faced ceaseless wars as a result of rivalry (2 Samuel 2:12ff3; 4; 5:1-5). Because David was gaining more territory towards the north, Abner became his rival. This resulted in war between the commander of Davids army (Joab) and Abners men. All 24 men selected from each side were killed. After this, a fierce battle began, in which Davids army defeated Abner and his men. God made David king over Israel after Abner and Ishbosheths death and all children of Israel willingly surrendered to Davids leadership.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>David also faced the challenge of being attacked by the Philistines, the most powerful enemy of Israel (2 Samuel 5:17-25). They occupied most of the northern territory of Israel and did not bother David when he was king over Judah. But on hearing that David was unifying Judah and Israel, they tried to stop him by waging war against him. David sought Gods face on whether to fight back and God gave him the go ahead. David fought and had victory over them. They waged war again and David went to seek Gods face again on the matter. God gave him specific instructions which he absolutely obeyed and he conquered them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, David also had personal struggles with sin and family issues. David committed sin of adultery and murder. He slept with Uriahs wife and killed him to cover up his sin but God exposed him. He faced the consequence of his sin although God forgave him (2 Samuel 11). Because of the sin David committed by killing Uriah so he could marry his wife, he faced a lot of family troubles as Prophet Nathan predicted in 2 Samuel 12:10-14. The first child Beersheba had for him died (2 Samuel12:18); murder became persistent in his family (2 Samuel 13:26-30), his household rebelled against him (2 Samuel15: 13), and his wives were taken away by other men (2 Samuel 16:20-23).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Prophet Jeremiah:<\/strong> Jeremiah was a prophet in Judah for forty (40) years. During this period, he was confronted with many ministry challenges but God saw him through them all. The first was his audiences indifference to his message. Despite his passionate warnings and consistent call for repentance, the people did not listen and they were not moved. He suffered rejection from his neighbours who plotted to kill him (Jeremiah 11:19-21). His people were taught to swear by Baal (Jeremiah 12:16). A false priest (Pashhur) had Jeremiah beaten up and put him in the stocks at the upper gate of Benjamin by the Lords temple. A false prophet (Hananiah) also lied to the people against him. He was defamed by his friends, audience and some kings wanted to have him killed (Jeremiah 20:1-2, 10, 26:8; 28:15). Jeremiah was also stopped from delivering his prophecies on many occasions. He was put in prison, thrown into a cistern, and was taken to Egypt against his will (Jeremiah 37:11-15; 38:1-6; 43:1-7). Despite all these challenges, Jeremiah was not discouraged. He declared the Word of God with boldness and faithfulness.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Jesus Christ<\/strong>: During Jesus earthly ministry, He went through series of challenges but He overcame them all. Some of these challenges were: \u00b7<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Temptations by Satan (Matthew 4:1-11) <\/li>\r\n\t<li>Rejection by His own people (Matthew 13:53-58)  <\/li>\r\n\t<li>Opposition from the Pharisees and other religious leaders (Matthew 19:1-12)<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Large multitude followed Him with wrong motive (John 6:25-27, 60-61,66)<\/li>\r\n\t<li> False accusation (Matthew 12:22-24)<\/li>\r\n\t<li> His authority was questioned (Luke 20:1-2)<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Gethsemane experience\/inner struggle with the flesh (Matthew 26:38-44)<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Betrayal by one of His twelve disciples (Matthew 26:47-50) In spite of all these challenges, He was obedient till death and God highly exalted Him (Philippians 2:8-9).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. The Disciples:<\/strong> the apostles during their time also faced lots of challenges which ranged from persecutions, arrests to eventual death. Some of their specific ministry challenges were:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\u00b7 Peter and John were arrested and put in jail by the priests, the captain of the temple guards and the Sadducees because they preached Jesus to the on lookers after the healing at the beautiful gate (Acts 4:1-3).<\/li>\r\n\t<li> The apostles were persecuted because of jealousy by the high priest and his associates. They were arrested and jailed for spreading the Gospel, but the angel of the Lord delivered them (Acts 5:17-19).<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Peter and other apostles were flogged and warned not to speak in the name of Jesus again (Acts 5:40).<\/li>\r\n\t<li> James, the brother of John was killed by King Herod. Peter was also imprisoned by King Herod for no just cause. God miraculously delivered him through an angel the night before he was to face public trial (Acts 12:1-10).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Paul and Silas were arrested, stripped, beaten and imprisoned for casting out the evil spirit in a slave girl who usually predicted the future through the spirit in her (Acts 16:22-24). God intervened in the mid-night when Paul and Silas were praising God (vv. 25-27).<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Paul, the apostle also faced lots of ministry challenges in the course of fulfilling his God-given mandate of preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles. He suffered persecutions of various kinds. He was arrested and beaten by the Jews (Acts 21:27-36), the Jews plotted to kill him (Acts 20:3, 23:12-15); he faced trials before the Sanhedrin, Felix and Festus the governors, and Agrippa the king (Acts 23; 24; 25; 26). He was also faced with sea storm and shipwreck on his way to Rome. He was attacked by a viper (a poisonous snake) on Malta Island although it had no effect on him. He was put in prison and killed by the sword according to Church History. He wrote some of his epistles while he was in prison.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>How can a believer or a pastor overcome ministry challenges?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Dealing with Challenges<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a bid to deal with ministry challenges, the first thing to do is self-examination. Here, one needs to ask him\/herself some questions such as<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>(I) Did God actually call me or did I call myself? (This applies to pastors and professional ministers only),<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) What is actually the assignment God gave me?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) Am I doing exactly what God has assigned for me to do or am I doing 1something else?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv) Am I doing the work of ministry the way God specified it to be done or am I doing it in my own way? These and many more questions will help us examine ourselves before God. There is no ministry that is free of challenges, but God who has called us is able to help us overcome any challenge that may come our way. We should understand that God knows us even more than we know ourselves. He knows our strengths and weaknesses, He loves us so dearly and He is ever present to help us in our troubles or challenges (Psalm 46:1). Having understood this, we can deal with ministry challenges by:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> prayerfully and critically examining the likely cause(s) of those challenges;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> confessing any known personal or corporate sin and asking God for forgiveness; <\/li>\r\n\t<li>seeking the Holy Spirits direction for a way out;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> listening attentively to the Holy Spirit as He speaks to you;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> giving self to diligent and meticulous personal Bible study and meditation;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> fasting and praying without ceasing until victory is achieved and thereafter;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> trusting God for victory and forging ahead without being discouraged;<\/li>\r\n\t<li> maintaining ones integrity and noble character at all times.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Challenges are inevitable in ministry.

It is accomplishing a mission to Gods glory and reaching\/attaining a divine goal set before us without having any stain on our good name. Finishing well also means fulfilling our calling and the purpose of our existence in a particular place of ministry over a particular period of time without destroying our integrity and our identity in Christ. It is realising our God-given vision for a specific period in life and ministry. The mission\/purpose of existence of every believer in Christ is to do the will of the Father. It is therefore very important for us to know exactly what the will of God is for our life, call and ministry, and then walk in that will in order to finish well. Watchman Nee said ...we have only one life to live down here and we are free to do as we please with it, but if we seek our own pleasure, our life will never glorify God.

If yes who are they?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Biblical Examples of People who Finished Well <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some Bible heroes from whose lives we can draw lessons because they finished well in ministry. They are people who served God faithfully without looking back despite all odds and the challenges they faced. They cut across the entire Bible, both Old and New Testament. In the Old Testament, we have people like Elijah, Elisha and Ruth to mention a few as examples. In the New Testament, we have Stephen, Timothy, Eunice and Lois as few examples.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Elijah (1 Kings 17-19):<\/strong> Elijah spent his ministry life fighting against idolatry and other forms of ungodliness in Israel. He suffered ridicule, criticism and insults for speaking the truth. He contended for righteousness by killing four hundred prophets of Baal and then received a threat from Jezebel. Although he went through moments of despair, he did not give up in the struggle. He stood to the end and he was taken to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:11).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Elisha (2 Kings 2-9; 13:14-21):<\/strong> Elisha was a prophet in Israel. He took after his spiritual father, Elijah. He was a faithful apprentice of Elijah and he received double portion of Elijahs anointing when Elijah was being taken to heaven. He served God and his people faithfully. After his death, his bones still had the supernatural power to raise the dead back to life (1Kings 13:20-21). He finished well in ministry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Ruth (Ruth 1-4):<\/strong> Ruth was a Moabite lady who followed Naomi, her mother-in-law back to Bethlehem in Israel after the death of Naomis husband, Elimelech and her two sons, Mahlon and Chilion one of whom was Ruths husband. Ruth having known the God of Israel through Naomi determined to devote the rest of her life to serve that God and to take up the ministry of caring for her aged mother-in-law. She was very faithful and diligent in her ministry. Afterward, God rewarded her by making her part of the lineage of Jesus Christ (Matthew 1:5). She finished well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Stephen (Acts 6:3-7):<\/strong> Stephen was one of the seven first set of deacons chosen in the church at Jerusalem. He was a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit (6:5). He was also full of Gods grace and power and did great wonders among the believers (6:8). None who argued with him could stand the wisdom or Spirit with which he spoke (6:10). He took his opponents back to history of the patriarchs and the Israelites behaviour during their journey in the wilderness with boldness (7:8). He finished his ministry well, although he was stoned to death, he died in active service.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. Timothy:<\/strong> Timothy was the spiritual son of Apostle Paul and the pastor of the church in Ephesus. Paul wrote two letters to him to nurture and guide him in the character, responsibilities and principles of effective leadership as a church leader. Timothy had good knowledge of the Scriptures and he upheld truth and godliness till the end. According to Church history, he was beaten to death when he confronted some pagans during their public festive procession within the city.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>f. Lois and Eunice (2 Timothy 1:5):<\/strong> Lois and Eunice were grandmother and mother of Timothy respectively. They were both committed to their ministry of godly parenting as God commanded in Deuteronomy 6:4-9, which is popularly known as shema. The evidence of their commitment to this ministry is clearly seen in Timothys life and from Pauls words about him,  I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also(NIV). Both women taught Timothy the way of the Lord and the impact of their godly teachings are revealed in his life and ministry. One can boldly say that they finished well.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Biblical Examples of People Who Failed in Ministry<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as there are people in the Bible who finished well in the ministry committed unto them, there are some people who failed as well. Eli the priest and King Saul are best examples for their inability to finish well. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Eli, the Priest (1 Samuel 2:12-36; 3:11-14; 4:12-22):<\/strong> Eli was a priest in Shiloh but his sons had no regard for God. They practiced abominable things in Gods sight, taking the best meat of sacrifice for their own and sleeping with the women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting. Eli was weak in rebuking them so they continued with the practice until God became angry with them. God pronounced a very fierce judgment against Elis household for honouring his sons more than Him. His two sons died the same day, the ark of God was captured by the philistines, Eli himself died from breaking his neck and the whole city cried for the ark that was taken away. The ministry was taken from him and was given to Samuel while he was still alive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. King Saul (1 Samuel 13:7-15; 15:1-29):<\/strong> Saul was Israels first king. He started well but later, turned away from the God who enthroned him as king and started disobeying Gods instructions. First, he offered the burnt offering, an assignment which was meant to be performed by Samuel because of impatience (13:9-10). Second, he disobeyed Gods instruction to kill all the Amalekites and their cattle by sparing Agag their king and the best of the sheep and other animals (15:9). These acts of pride and disobedience cost him the kingdom and he was rejected as king over Israel (13:14; 15:23,28).

Thus, certain conditions are necessary for every believer to finish well in ministry. One of such conditions is Gods mercy. Gods mercy is not something anyone can receive through personal effort.

This suggests that our participation in ministry work is crucial as members of Christs body. God does not reckon with spectators and bench warmers in His household and that is why He has equipped every believer with various, spiritual gifts. As Christs disciples however, we must trust God for grace to overcome every challenge that may appear in the course of serving and as well trust Him for grace to finish well.

It specifically mentions a great increase in false prophets within the Church. Jesus teaches us that false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead people astray, if possible, even the elect (Matthew 24:24). Today, all over the world, there are a lot of apostles and prophets who parade themselves as of God but are not. Thus, it is vital that we enlighten ourselves about these end-time agents so as to discern the fake from the true ones.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Who is a False Prophet?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the way the word &quot;prophet&quot; is commonly used, there is a misconception about who a prophet really is. The basic definition for the word prophet is &quot;someone who foretells the future.&quot; Another definition of a prophet is &quot;one who speaks for another.&quot; A true prophet, then, is a person who speaks for God, delivering a message on Gods behalf on things to come. Thus, a prophets essential role is to speak on Gods behalf regardless of the timing of the message. A prophet expresses the will of God in words and sometimes with signs to back it up to demonstrate Gods power.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A false Prophet is not necessarily in the business of foretelling the future. He is simply someone who speaks for another but falsely. False prophets either speak for the wrong god or they claim to have heard from the true God but do not accurately represent Him or His words. At the very least, they speak out of their own sensibility but more likely, they speak for the wrong gods.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foretelling the future correctly is not the determining factor when considering whether a prophet is a true or false prophet. What matters is whether the one who claims to be representing God and speaking for Him is doing so genuinely or falsely. A prophet may accurately predict an event or demonstrate supernatural power but if he is leading people away from the worship of the true God, he is a false prophet.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>How can we recognise someone who is a prophet of God from a false prophet?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Characteristics of False Prophets<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The characteristics of false prophets are revealed:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. By their Immoral Teachings <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False prophets will not hold the moral track that God requires.Lamentations 2:14 says The prophets have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captives, but have envisioned for you false prophecies and delusions.&quot; False prophets follow after their selfish desires as against the standard of God for living. They focus on those things that will benefit them other than Gods standard of righteousness.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. By their Exploitation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False prophets take advantage of peoples desperate need for solutions to their problems to enrich themselves. The book of 2 Peter 2:3 says: &quot;By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber&quot;. False prophets &quot;walk according to the flesh.&quot; They are more concerned about physical things than the things of God. They are not interested in doing Gods will rather, they are concerned about things that will profit them. They also worry little about resisting sin. Their hearts are especially drawn towards covetousness, and like Balaam, they are ever willing to do anything for personal gain. False prophets perform signs and wonders that are neither true nor authentic.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. By their Fruits<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False Prophets are known by the fruits they produce. The Bible warns us to beware of them. They come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. (Matthew 7:15) These men are characterised by deception, pretence and lies. It is a fact that every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, neither can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into fire.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. By their Words <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A false prophet is someone who claims to be speaking for God but whose message is contrary to Gods. False prophets will not convict people of sin, for they themselves are not convicted. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While true prophets speak according to Gods law and testimony, false prophets speak words that suit them and that will draw people to them. They tell people what they want to hear and not what God says about them. A true prophet expresses the will of God alone and nothing more.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. By their Authorities <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False prophets always claim to have access to information that anyone cannot access without them. They play on peoples intelligence to pronounce words with fake authority as a way of pretending to be from God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>f. By their Hopes <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some sort of reassurance or certainty they offer, but it is always transactional or conditional in nature. True hope is independent of conditions or circumstances, just like agape love does not require anything in return. Conditional and contingent hope is what they give rather than assurance in Gods ability and power.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>g. By their Gospels <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False prophets preach self. They back up their words with propaganda that is not real. They emphasise their message with aggression, which is not the sole purview of Christian preachers. They offer vain promises by stating that the peoples imperfections, problems, sense of lack, want, etc., can be taken away if they get the formula right. The true Gospel is mainly about Jesus and His redemptive work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>h. By their Healings <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False prophets use fake powers for healing. Though they call on the name of Jesus but their hearts are far away from God. Those who fall prey of their deception experience temporary sense of fulfilment. Most times, they use evil powers to perform miracles and healings.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>How can we handle false prophets who preach other gospels apart from the Gospel of Christ?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. &quot;Beware!&quot; <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False prophets take advantage of the fact that not many people are grounded in the fundamentals of biblical truths. To detect a counterfeit, one must first know what the original looks like. We cannot get a clear picture of absolute truth without having the knowledge of the Word of God. Unless we are firmly rooted in Gods Word and led by His Spirit, we can easily be led astray. False prophets promote salvation through works and not through faith alone. Also, one must belong to their society, institution or church to be saved. What makes them different from real prophets are as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Different Source:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>: A true prophet speaks from the Bible while a false prophet relies on his own creativity. Some false prophets make use of the sixth and seventh books of Moses which is not part of the 66 books of the Bible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Different Message:<\/strong> For the true prophets, message, Jesus Christ is central while self and intimidation is the core message of false prophets. False prophets speak a lot about how other people can help change your life. A careful look at the message of false prophets will reveal that Jesus Christ is not essential in his message.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Different Character:<\/strong> A true prophet pursues goodness, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love while a false prophet is marked by arrogance and slander. False prophets are &quot;experts in greed&quot; and &quot;their eyes are full of immorality&quot;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Different Appeal:<\/strong> The appeal of a true prophet is what God says but the false prophet makes a rather different appeal: They appeal to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, by enticing their victims with lies and sweet talks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. Different Fruit:<\/strong> The true prophet is effective and productive in his knowledge of Jesus Christ. The false prophet is highly immoral in conduct even with those following him.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>f. Different End:<\/strong> A true prophet is conscious of heaven and this is his ultimate goal or focus but a false prophet cares less about heaven and his ultimate goal is his gains in the world.Jesus tells us that there will be many who have been involved in ministering in His name, to whom He will say, &quot;Depart from me; I never knew you&quot; (Matthew 7:21).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>As believers, what should be our response towards dubious ministers at such a time like this?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Today, many people call themselves apostles and prophets of God.

WHO IS A FALSE TEACHER? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>False teachers are those who distract Christians from obeying the truth of the Word of God. They speak to distort the Word of God either out of ignorance or for their selfish ambition. False teachers hinder other Christians from obeying the truth of Gods word. These false teachers get the church off track and away from clear direction given by the Word of God. This is reason why Paul commended the Galatian believers for running a good race. Running a race was one of Pauls favourite images for living the Christian life. This image portrays how well they obeyed the truth they had received.

They are agents of Satan who lack understanding of Gods Word and hang on what they believe.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. False Teachers Throw Dirt at Gods People:<\/strong> False teachers are notable for casting dirt, scorn, and reproach upon the persons, names, and credits of Gods people. They drag the name of God in the mud and subject Gods name to reproach<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. False Teachers Use Clever Languages and Appearances to Disguise Themselves:<\/strong> False teachers cover up their dangerous principles and soul-impostures with very fair speeches and plausible pretence, with high notions and golden expressions so that people can believe them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. False Teachers are Men-pleasers:<\/strong> False teachers are menpleasers. They preach more to please the ear than to profit the heart (Galatians 1:10; 1Timothy 4:1-5). False teachers are hells greatest enrichers, making use of flattering words and engaging in all kinds of mischief.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. False Teachers Disobey Gods Law and the Gospel for other Things:<\/strong> False teachers overlook some weighty things in Gods word. They are comfortable with things that are of less concern to the souls of men and negligent of the greater.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>f. False Teachers Extort their Followers in the Name of Helping Them:<\/strong> False teachers make merchandise of their followers. They are more interested in what they will get from them and not seeing what they do as a service to God. Their aim is not to save souls. All they want is to exploit their followers and care less if Satan have their souls (Jeremiah 6:13).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>g. False Teachers Strive to Convince People to Accept their Ideas or Opinions:<\/strong> False teachers strive to win men over to their opinions, than accept other peoples opinion. They believe they are knowledgeable and have better ideas about everything. They tend to enlighten and convince men to accept their falsehood by proving to know better than them and by doing this, they lead many astray.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Testing Authenticity and Counterfeit?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book of 1 John 4:1 states that we should believe not every spirit but try the spirits, whether they are of God (KJV). The reason is that many false prophets have gone out into the world and are leading believers astray. What are some of the identifying marks of a false teacher\/prophet? Below is a list of the warning signs we are to look out for when testing the authenticity of the teachings of false teachers:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a) False Prophecy:<\/strong> The most obvious way to tell if someone is a false prophet or teacher is if he or she prophesies falsely. The Bible says that we are not to revere the one who speaks in the name of the Lord disrespectfully (Deuteronomy 18:22). This means that prophecy is not something to be taken lightly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b) Rejection of Gods Ways:<\/strong> The main test of teachers of Gods Word is not whether they make accurate predictions or perform signs and wonders, but that their message conforms to the Word of God. Thus, if a teacher of Gods Word teaches contrary to the commandments of God, he is a false teacher and his teachings must be discarded False teachers who speak against Gods commandments abound today. They encourage believers to abandon clear biblical injunctions regarding sexual morality. Sadly, these teachers misinterpret biblical teachings and lead many people astray. We need to be wary of these false teachers and not be afraid to call them out from our midst because they are nothing but wolves.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c) Misrepresentation of the Gospel:<\/strong> False teachers pervert Gods Word (Galatians 1:7). They do not only distort the message of the Gospel, but also distort the true purpose of Gods Word. The Gospel is central to our faith as Christians, and we must be wary of anyone who misrepresents it. As Paul warns in Galatians 1:7, no one, not even a great preacher, has the right to change the message that God has given us. If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned! (Galatians 1:9).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d) Obsession over Foolish Controversies<\/strong>: According to Paul in 1Timothy 1:3-7, false teachers lack understanding of the Scriptures and sound theology. Therefore, they devote themselves to myths and drag people into vain discussions. In a number of places in the New Testament, such as 2 Timothy 2:16, we are told to stay away from pointless discussions. Why? People will become more and more ungodly. Because a false teacher who promotes foolish controversies leads people into ungodly behaviour. Today, many false teachers promote their myths, conspiracy theories, and secret knowledge to the masses. False teachers who spend all their time feeding Gods sheep theological junks should be avoided.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e) Selfish and Opportunistic Behaviour:<\/strong> Prophet Micah describes false priests and prophets as those who teach for a price and practice divination for money (Micah 3:11). False teachers are concerned only with entertaining the flock in order to achieve their own selfish gain. Indeed, false teachers often do not truly care about instructing believers in the ways of God. They simply see ministry as an opportunity to make money. If you notice a teacher consistently promoting himself rather than promoting the Messiah, flee from such.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>The best way to guard oneself against falsehood and false teachers is to know the truth through understanding of Gods Word. To spot a counterfeit, study the real thing. Any believer who correctly handles the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15) and who studies the Bible carefully can identify false doctrine. For example, a believer who has read of the activities of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (as in Matthew 3:16-17) will immediately question any doctrine that denies the Trinity. We are to examine all teaching in the light of the Scriptures. We must discipline ourselves in the study of the Scriptures so that we can easily recognise the counterfeits when we see them.

Today, God is still in the business of performing miracles. His reason for performance of miracles is to save humankind from satanic oppressions and to demonstrate his power over the devil and his works. Satan is a great deceiver, he devises various means of deceiving people. He often uses people of whom false teachers, false prophets and false miracle workers are part (2 Peter 2:1; 2 Thessalonians 2:9).. They use deception to threaten the existence of the Church. They mislead many to believe they are from God including believers whereas they are agents of darkness (Matthew 7:21-23; 24:24, Mark 13:22, 2 Thessalonians 2:8-12; Revelation 13:13, 14; 16:14; 19:20).

A true miracle worker is someone who has given his life totally to God and uses Gods power to perform miracles. He is someone who is Christ-like and humble. On the contrary, a false miracle-worker is a self-centred person and lacks the presence of the Holy Spirit. He turns people away from God, sees himself as ultimate and uses other powers to perform his enterprise. False miracle workers do not use sound doctrines to back up the miracles they perform. As believers, there is the need for us never to trust everyone. Even the Bible tells us &quot;not to believe everyone...&quot; but test the spirits whether they are from God (1 John 4:1). However, the testing we are to do must be with the intent of finding out its genuineness or otherwise.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"","interaction2":"<p><strong>II.

As a result, people travel miles in search of signs and wonders. However, God warns that in the end-time, an evil and adulterous generation will seek after a sign (Matthew 12:38-39). Seeking signs at all cost without Gods approval is dangerous. As believers, we should hold on to what the Bible says.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. They Misuse the Name of Jesus Christ:<\/strong> It is an assumption that any miracle done in the name of Jesus is in line with Gods will. It is unfortunate that the heart behind the miracles false miracle workers perform is not right. Their miracles are guided by false motive. Their hearts are guided by envy, pride and boastfulness. They certainly have scant regard for true holiness and a disciplined lifestyle. They seem to be &quot;Christian magicians&quot; using the name and power of Jesus as a camouflage for their evil deeds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d.

While some challenges arise from outside thehurch, there are also challenges from within. Examples of such are false prophets, false teachers, false miracle-workers and the likes. False gospel ministers take on many forms, custom-crafted to times, cultures, and contexts. Todays lesson is to open our eyes to the need for believers to respond accurately against the schemes of false end-time ministers.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. JESUS REACTION TO FALSE MINISTERS<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus Christ in Matthew 7:15 said believers should beware of false prophets. He also warns against people who disguise as believers. Jesus described them as people whose outward appearance appears to be His followers but inwardly, they are ravenous wolves seeking to destroy the flock. When Jesus interacted with people who were lost, wandering, or misguided, He was always compassionate on them. He answered them with patience and gentleness. But Jesus responded with righteous fury and bold conviction when He engaged the religious hypocrites and false teachers. An example of Jesus arguments in Matthew 23 was His warnings to the crowds against following the evil practices of the scribes and Pharisees. Jesus publicly addressed the false doctrine of these religious leaders for the benefit of saving their victims and potential victims from further error. The issues Jesus pointed out about the evil practices of false ministers are the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Jesus Points Out their Doctrinal Error:<\/strong> Jesus pointed out how the religious authorities were masking error as truth. Jesus confronts their error by telling the crowd, They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on peoples shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger (Matthew 23:4). The religious leaders adapt their beliefs so they can remain righteous according to the letter of the law while violating its spirit. Jesus identifies this as false doctrine and addresses it head-on. When our response to error is giving it the benefit of doubt, we are invariably committing the same error as false teachers who mask error as the truth. Like Jesus, we ought to love truth and this we can do by knowing the truth through daily study of Gods Word and obeying it accordingly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Jesus Points Out their Unrighteous Actions:<\/strong> The religious authorities were teaching the people error as truth and acting hypocritically. Jesus warns the crowd of the doctrinal error of these leaders and their ungodly actions (Matthew 23:23-26). He revealed the unrighteous actions of false teachers. Some may find it difficult to reconcile Jesus love and His bold rebuke in this scene, but this portrays a dangerous tendency to separate Gods love from His relentless demand for truth. We dishonour God when we call unrighteousness good (Isaiah 5:20). God is honoured when we run away from any form of unrighteousness.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Jesus Points Out their True Identity<\/strong>: Having pointed out their hypocritical lifestyle, He appropriately describes the false teachers. In Matthew 23:3-12, Jesus did not shy away from calling false teachers exactly what they were. Jesus pronounced wrath on those who hide the truth and teach doctrines different from what the Bible teaches. As believers, we must always avoid slandering people by calling them what they are not. In addition, we must always make the Bible our guide in words and deeds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Jesus Points Out Their Coming Judgment:<\/strong> Jesus declared to the people the gravity of blasphemy and the impending judgement on false ministers. Jesus told the people that adhering to faulty teachings attracts consequences. From the passage, Jesus repeated the word woe about seven times to show the seriousness of the offence. It describes the misery that portends a final, miserable end for false ministers. They will not, and neither will those who submit to such horrible evil will not escape judgement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>e. Jesus Points His Listeners Toward the Truth:<\/strong> Jesus appeals to His listeners to turn away from the absurdity and inconsistency of error toward Gods truth. Contrary to the scribes and Pharisees who do all their deeds to be seen by others, Jesus tells the crowd: The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted (Matthew 23:11-12).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"","interaction2":"<p><strong>I. PAUL AND PETERS REACTIONS TO FALSE MINISTERS<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many think it is wrong to speak against false teachers or false prophets, or to warn Christians not to follow particular teachers because what they teach is against what the Bible teaches. What does the Bible say about this? Some people refuse to speak out against these so called men of God for fear of the unknown. However, believers should emulate the reactions of Peter and Paul as examples to follow.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul specifically exhorts the brethren that they should be careful of false ministers who are deceitful liars and spread wrong teachings. In verse 6, he advises that believers should teach one another the truth of Gods Word without being ashamed so they could become good ambassadors for Christ in the teaching of His Word to others. Paul further warns that we should keep away from evil and foolish discussions which only drive people farther away from God (1 Timothy 4:1-2, 6; 2 Timothy 2:15-18).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Peter warns of the rise in false teachers within the church. But it is not without reason as we are in the end time. He noticed that the heresies they preach are &quot;destructive&quot; and that following them will &quot;bring the way of truth into disrepute.&quot; In addition, he said that in doing all these, they bring upon themselves sudden destruction (2 Peter 2:1-3). Other warnings exist in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. This has shown that it is not wrong to confront and speak out against false teachers, because of the spiritual devastation they cause, it is our obligation as Christs disciples to speak against their evil practices whenever we have the opportunity and teach others the truth of Gods Word. When people around us know the truth, the truth will set them free.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. HOW THE CHURCH CAN CONFRONTFALSE MINISTERS <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. The Church should Differentiate False Ministers from True Ministers <\/strong>Student doctors are trained on how to diagnose illnesses by the symptoms as they present themselves. In the same way, Paul in Titus 1:10-13 provides us with some diagnostic tools to recognise false ministers. He instructs us to observe their character (as insubordinate, empty talkers, deceivers, etc.), their tactics (upsetting families, playing to the culture), and their motivation (shameful gain).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. The Church should Rebuke False Ministers<\/strong> When Paul told the believers in Titus 1:13-14 to rebuke them sharply, he used a play on word with reference to false ministers promotion of circumcision. In effect, Paul says, Use the sharp knife of correction with those who wield the dull blade of circumcision. Paul is not advocating legal action, neither is he promoting a witch hunt but false teaching is so dangerous that it requires corrective action immediately it is noticed before it spreads its canker worm like cancer. The goal of that corrective action is so that they may be sound in the faith (1:13). The word translated sound can also mean healthy. True spiritual health comes from the Gospel, not false teaching.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. The Church should Resist False Ministers<\/strong> Having the knowledge of what the Gospel teaches about various subjects is the preventive vaccine that enables the believer to resist false ministers. Truly embracing this vaccine produces not merely head knowledge of the Gospel, but good works that flow out genuinely from the heart through the saving faith. Regardless of whether you are an elder or not, every believer is responsible for identifying true ministers. The Gospel is the only way that we can be made pure, because it points us to the only one who is truly pure - Jesus Christ.Everyone who puts their hope on Him is purified in anticipation of His return (1 John 3:3).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Believers should recognise that we are in the end-time. The Bible has given us various signs which will enable us know that we are in the end-time.

We must BEWARE of them. False gospel ministers are now on the increase and they will continue to increase as long as Jesus has not yet come. But Jesus and other patriarchs in the Bible have given us antidotes that can help us recognise and speak strongly against the works of these evil men. We must embrace our responsibility of defending the faith that we have received and protect the vulnerable. Jesus has left us with both the mandate and the model of keeping the faith and helping the weak so that they will not fall prey into the snare of so called ministers of the gospel.<\/p>\r\n","activity_period":"<p>1.

This is the reason why we need laws to keep order and for citizens to stay on track. Without laws, the society will be in disarray. These laws are made to maintain order and as a necessary control against the inherent greed in human nature. Man-made laws are made by an arm of government called the legislature both at the Federal and State levels. Gods laws are contained in different books of the Scriptures. In Exodus 20, God spoke to all the people through Moses on Mount Sinai. God gave Moses Ten (10) commandments to serve as guide for the activities of the people.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Understanding the Law of the Land<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law is a system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its citizens and which may be enforced by the imposition of penalties. It is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behaviour and lifestyle of its citizens. The law of the land is the collection of traditions, customs, statutes, usages, and laws of a country that apply to everyone, including the government, under the jurisdiction of the courts. In Nigeria, there are basically two types of laws, Civil and Criminal laws. Civil laws deal basically with the lawsuits brought by individuals, Organizations and Companies. Criminal law on the other hand is a system of law concerned with the punishment of the offenders. It is the kind of law enforced by the police when crimes such as murder, assaults, robbery, rape, manslaughter and so on are committed.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Sources of Law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sources from which laws derive their authority and coercive force are constitutions, treaties, statutes, usages, and customs. In another sense, the authoritative or reliable works, records, documents, edicts, etc. forms the basis for what constitutes the law. Basically, the sources of the Nigerian legal system include the received English law, Nigerian legislations, religious law, customary law and case law. The stand of case law is however subject to debate. In Christendom, the Bible remains our only source with rules for Christian living. Indeed, it consists of the commandments which God expects us to keep in obedience to Him. The constitution remains the grand norm\/ supreme law of the land. In fact, where other laws conflict with the provisions of the Constitution, the Constitution supersedes.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Is the law of the land helpful to you and members of your family?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Functions of Law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law serves many purposes. Indeed, everyone is accountable to the same laws, and those laws protect our fundamental rights. Law helps to establish standards in the society. It is an instrument for the maintenance of orderliness. Law aids resolution of disputes and protects liberties and rights. Basically, law is a guidepost for minimally acceptable behaviour in the society. Law can be said to perform four different functions, each of which is of huge importance to our welfare.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Defending us from evil:<\/strong> The first and most basic function of law is to defend us from evil - that is, those who would seek to harm us for no good reason.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Promoting the common good:<\/strong> Law is not just concerned with bringing evil people to account for their actions. A community made up of people who bear no ill-will to anyone else and are simply pursuing their own self-interest needs law because there are situations where if everyone pursues his\/her own self-interest, everyone will be worse off than they would have been if they acted differently. So, a community of self-interested actors need laws to: (i) solve Prisoners dilemma situations; (ii) distribute into private hands property that would otherwise be exploited by everyone, thereby avoiding a tragedy of the commons situation arising; (iii) prevent people from acting on their natural desire to extract an eye for an eye in revenge for actual or perceived wrongs that they have suffered at other peoples hands.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Resolving disputes over limited resources:<\/strong> In any community, there will always be disputes over who should have access to resources that are limited. Law is needed to resolve these disputes, as exemplified by the famous story of the wise judgment of Solomon in the Bible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Encouraging people to do the right thing:<\/strong> The law performs a fourth function - that of encouraging and helping people to do the right thing. For example, Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) argued that people needed the discipline of law to habituate them into doing the right thing, from which standpoint they could then appreciate why doing the right thing was the right thing to do.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"<p><strong>IV. The Body Empowered for the Compliance of the Law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nigerian courts are empowered to ensure compliance with the law of the land. No one is above the law in the law court. The Supreme Court is the highest in the hierarchy of courts. It is the final arbiter and no appeals can lie from it. Other courts are Federal and State High Courts, Customary Courts, Sharia Courts, Magistrate Courts, National Industrial Courts, the Court of Appeal among others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>V. The Rule of Law<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the law of the land to serve its purpose, the Rule of Law must be in place. The fact is nobody is above the law. In other words, in a governing system based on the rule of law, everybody is held equally accountable under the same laws. This implies that:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>i. The law applies to everyone:<\/strong> The law is applied equally to all citizens, including the lawmakers themselves. Therefore, even people who enforce and administer the law, such as police officers, judges, and lawyers, are still subject to the same laws as everybody else is.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ii. The laws are not secret or arbitrary:<\/strong> If the laws change too frequently or arbitrarily, then citizens have little hope of being able to abide by those laws. The laws must not violate fundamental human rights, which would make them unfair to citizens.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iii. The laws are to be enforced fairly:<\/strong> It is one thing for the laws to be written fairly, but if they are enforced in such a way that is either arbitrary or unfair then, the rule of law does not stand. All citizens are subjected to the rule of law and so have the right to know that the laws are being administered and enforced in a way that is fair and accessible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iv. The justice system must be fair:<\/strong> Not only must laws be enforced in a fair and non-arbitrary manner; justice should also be delivered in a way that is fair, accessible, and efficient. In other words, the judicial system must stand independent of external interference, such as politicians or law enforcement agencies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rule of Law is foundational to many functioning governments around the world. It helps to establish a system whereby the fundamental rights and dignity of individuals and groups within a country are respected.

This means that the responsibility of the National legislative is shared between two separate assemblies - <strong>the Senate <\/strong>and <strong>the House of Representatives<\/strong>, both chambers make up what is known as the National Assembly. It is the primary law making body in Nigeria. In Nigeria, the Constitution provides for a body saddled with the responsibility of making laws for the country. This body is known as the legislature, an arm of government which is provided for in Chapter V of the 1999 Constitution. Lawmakers (in National Assembly or State Assembly) are those conferred with the responsibility of making laws in Nigeria. The essence of the Constitution is to promote good governance; maintain peace and harmony among Nigerians, this is in conformity with the divine laws. According to the Bible, we are made to understand that God is the originator of law. The Bible (which is the word and commandment of God) has primarily laid down rules to guide the activities of man in relation to one another and to God. As Christians, we are to participate in civic affairs. We should accept positions of responsibility in the nation and community when they are entrusted to us.

A bill is a draft of a proposed law that is presented before he legislature for deliberation and discussion. A bill can technically be initiated by anybody but only a Senator or a member of the House of Representatives can introduce it on the floor of the Senate or House of Representatives. A bill can originate either from the Executive (President) or from the members of the legislature.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stage 2:<\/strong> Once a bill is received in either of the chambers of the legislature, the head of the chamber (Senate President or Speaker) forwards it to the relevant committee. The committee reviews the bill to determine if it meets all the required standards to be presented before the chamber. If the standards are not met, it is forwarded to the legal department of the National Assembly for re-drafting and other amendments that need to be made to bring it in line with the requirements. The committee is also expected to determine the day and the time a bill is to be discussed in the Senate\/House. All bills must receive three readings before they can be passed into law and the readings must be on different days. However in very rare circumstances, some bills can receive accelerated consideration based on their urgency and significance for government policy. Where this happens, the rules of the Senate\/House are to be suspended for easy passage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stage 3:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assent by the President:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Once there is concurrence of the bill in both chambers, the clerk of the National Assembly will enrol the bill for the Presidents signature. Enrolment is when the clerk of the National Assembly produces a clean copy of the bill, certifies it, and forwards it to the President for his\/her assent. The President has thirty (30) days to sign a bill sent to him\/her by the National Assembly.

These laws were made by God for man, to enhance and promote good fellowship, peace and harmony among His creations. The book of Revelation 4:2-6 shows the supremacy of God and why He has made these laws. The divine law was given as a directive from God and was convened to the Israelites through Moses.

This includes income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, various license fees, etc. On one occasion, Jesus arranged a small miracle so an appropriate fee could be paid to the authorities even though there was some doubt about whether the fee was due (Matthew 17:24-27). In this example, Jesus bent over backwards to be sure government taxes and local fees were paid. Jesus never encouraged anyone to be a tax resistor, and Christians should not be tricked into adopting such a foolhardy and non-biblical position.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Is a Christian at liberty to choose what law to obey or not to obey?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Biblical Examples of Law Keepers<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Moses:<\/strong> Moses admonished the Israelites to obey the commandments of the Lord. In Deuteronomy 4:1-49, he admonished the children of Israel after they had left Egypt. He encouraged them to observe the judgments and statutes he taught them so they can possess the land which the Lord God is giving them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Jesus:<\/strong> Our Lord Jesus Christ was and is still our perfect example. His perfect obedience secures the righteousness we could never attain on our own. He humbled Himself and took upon Himself a ritual for our sake despite His perfection (Luke 3:21). In Matthew 5:17-18, Jesus said Do not think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I did not come to destroy the law or the prophets. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one title will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. The law was kept perfectly by Christ. And all its penalties against Gods sinful people were poured out on Christ. Therefore, the law is now manifestly not the path to righteousness but Christ is. If there is no law, there can be no transgression. Christ fulfilled the Law according to Matthew 5: 17-20. Christians are enjoined to obey human laws except where such laws violate the laws of God. Our supreme duty is to obey God. <\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>What are the benefits of keeping the law?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. A Disciples Responsibilities to the State<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Obey the Laws of the State:<\/strong> Christians are to obey the law, and to adopt a stance of friendliness to ones government and ruling officials. This is a simple but potent idea for Christians. We must never joke with the rules of the state. We should exude healthy warmth for our country and strive to obey the law and leaders.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Payment of Taxes:<\/strong> Payment of tax as a disciple or citizen of a country is mandatory. Tax funds serve as a source of revenue for the government. Everyone liable to pay tax must do so, be it personal income tax, value added tax, etc. Some Christians or disciples justify their non-payment of taxes on grounds of the governments corrupt practices. This is stealing which the Bible forbids in Exodus 20:15. The Roman government in the Bible was corrupt and hated the Jews, yet, Jesus still taught His disciples to pay their taxes. In Matthew 22:17-21, the Pharisees plotted against Jesus saying Tell us, therefore, what you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Jesus response to them in verse 21 is give to Caesar what is Caesars and to God, what is Gods.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Participation in Civic Affairs:<\/strong> As Christians, we are to participate in civic affairs. We should be ready to hold positions of responsibility in the nation and community and do it well when they are entrusted to us. We are to participate in voting during elections and perform duties and functions necessary for societal growth. Scripture teaches us to care for all of the duties given to us as a Christian. Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men (Colossians 3:23).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. All Christs Disciples are to be Law Keepers:<\/strong> The reason many Christians believe it is important to obey the law of the land, is because when searching the Scriptures, we recognize that this is clearly a part of Gods revealed will for our lives. The Bible teaches us that God has instituted all human government, and according to Romans 13:1, no government exists apart from Gods will. Obeying laws and rules, speaking well of our authorities, praying for them, paying our taxes fairly, and other such deeds show that we are unique people, people who honour the government and submit to it and it in turn honours and respects us.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>Is it right to pay tax to an unjust and highly corrupt government headed by a non-Christian?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>As Christs disciples, our citizenship is not only of this world but also of heaven (Philippians 3:20).

The law of the land creates a duty to do or not to do an act and the law can be made at different levels, that is, they can be organizational, industrial, local, state or federal level. An example of these laws are: The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 Constitution (as amended), the Criminal Code Act, the Labour Act, the Company and Allied Matters Act, the Cybercrime Act, the Money Laundering Act, Rules, Regulations, Bye-laws and legal procedures.

Are Christians free to speak evil of individuals in authority if they do not like what they do? What about taxes? Does God require that they be paid? All Christians live in a physical country on earth. Every country has some form of human government. There is no escaping the need to address how and whether a Christian is required to obey man-made laws, statutes and ordinances. However, there can be no power, or any government, except what God allows.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>How can we identify and deal with an unjust law?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. The Law Breakers<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law breakers according to the Scriptures are those who transgress the commandments of God. They are generally referred to as sinners. The children of Israel are often cited as example of a disobedient generation (Nehemiah 9:26) but truly, man has been a law breaker from creation till now. In the world today, law breakers are either those who commit criminal acts or civil wrong against the state, individuals or group of persons. They include; murderers, armed robbers, thieves, conspirators, forgers, kidnappers, rapist, traffic offenders, tax evaders, liars, impersonators, pirates and so on. Scripturally, anyone who disobeys Gods Word is a lawbreaker (Galatians 5:19-21). The scope is wider than that of the state because Gods law does not only guide the act of man but his heart, spirit and soul (Psalm 119: 11; John 6:63).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a purpose behind every provision of the law. The common aspect of law often broken by men is traffic law and tax law. The Bible admonishes us to give unto Caeser what belongs to Ceaser (Matthew 22:17-22). Thus, we are to give to our country what belongs to it. We are also to give to God what belongs to God (Malachi 3:8-10). Disobedience to traffic regulations is often handled with levity. People disobey traffic regulations on a daily basis. These offences range from not having the relevant and complete vehicle particulars to jumping traffic lights. All these are law breaking acts (Romans 13:1-3). Peter is quick to say that If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other peoples affairs. (1Peter 4:15) A Christian, who experiences the natural consequence of sinful choices, including being punished by the state for criminal activity, should not make the mistake of thinking he or she is suffering for Christ. No Christian is obligated to suffer as a murderer or thief or meddler. No Christian is required by God to suffer for doing anything immoral or evil. Even if we are being wrongly persecuted, insulted, or falsely accused, we are called to good and moral conduct<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Discuss how Christs disciples can efficiently keep Gods commands without breaking man-made laws and vice versa.<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Punishment of Law Breakers in the Bible<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Anyone found guilty of an offence is liable to punishment. The punishments for breaking laws are enshrined in the law creating the offence and as finally determined by the court of law after trial. The various types of punishment that exist in the law of a state include; death sentence, life imprisonment, term of imprisonment and payment of fine. Our God is a just Judge. He is a forgiving father but He punishes us sometimes to bring us back to Him. We can see from the Scripture that He either declares an instant judgment on the law breakers or places a curse on them (Genesis 3:14-17; Genesis 4:10- 11; Deuteronomy 28:15). Another thing as to the punishment of breaking the law of God is that there is a place of warning and repentance (no matter the offence) which if not forsaken can avert punishment or curse from God (Jeremiah 18:8; 15:9).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"","interaction4":"<p><strong>IV.

The Constitution and various Acts\/Legislations of the National Assembly such as the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, the Criminal Code, Penal Code, and Violence against Persons (Prohibition) Act and so on prescribe the penalties for breaking a particular law for example:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> Murder - Death penalty<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Rape - Life imprisonment but where the offender is less than 14 years, maximum of 14years imprisonment and in other cases, minimum of 12 years (Violence Against Person (Prohibition) Act 2015).<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Robbery - Not less than 21years imprisonment<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Armed Robbery - Death penalty<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Stealing - 3years imprisonment<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Man slaughter - Life imprisonment<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Assault - One year imprisonment<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Money laundering - 7-14years imprisonment<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Impersonation - 3years imprisonment<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Forgery - 3years (C.C.) &amp; 14 years under P .C.

An unrepentant law breaker of both the law of God and man-made laws will receive punishment which is eternal damnation. We are enjoined to obey God and lawful authorities too.

This is a reversal of the godly order. But one thing is sure, every sin comes with punishment. Today, we shall be considering the benefits that come with being a law abiding citizen particularly in this corrupt generation.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. What does it Mean to be Law Abiding?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a dictionary definition, to be law abiding means obeying or keeping the law. A law-abiding person is one who always obeys the law and is considered to be good and honest because of this. The Bible makes it very clear in Romans 13:1-7 that we should obey the government God places over us. God created government to establish order, punish evil, and promote justice (Genesis 9:6; 1 Corinthians 14:33; Romans 12:8).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the level of decadence in the society, one begins to wonder why it is needful for a disciple of Christ to be law abiding even when every other person in the society is doing otherwise, hence the popular saying: if you cant beat them, join them. However, from the life of Apostle Paul, we learn that no matter the state of things in the society, we must maintain our stand and abide by the law. When the Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans, he was under the government of Rome during the reign of Nero, perhaps the most evil of all the Roman emperors. Paul still recognised the Roman governments rule over him and was law abiding. Why then should we do less? We are therefore enjoined to obey the government in everything by paying taxes, obeying rules and laws and showing respect to the authorities. When we do otherwise, we are definitely showing disrespect towards God, for He is the originator and the one who chooses those in government<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Discuss the reason why and ways one can be law abiding in the society?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Reasons for being a Law Abiding Citizen? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Being law abiding is a proof of being a responsible citizen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. In Matthew 5:17-19, one of the reasons why our Lord Jesus Christ came to fulfil the law is to be an example so that we can also follow His steps.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Rules and laws are set for us to follow and are for our own good and safety. They are set to regulate human relationships, hence the saying, Where there are no laws, there is no sin (Hebrews 13:17, ESV).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Another reason why we should be law abiding is to avoid Gods wrath upon our lives and to have a clear conscience (Romans 13:5, ESV).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. We have a duty to pass a legacy of good virtues to the next generation, and obedience to the law of the land is a good virtue.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Obeying the law of the land by paying our dues also increases the revenue of the government, so they can in turn be able to provide the basic amenities needed for the society at large.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. When we obey authorities, we are submitting to one another and it is an act of reverence to God (Ephesians 5:21, ESV).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Benefits of being a Law Abiding Citizen? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

An ex-convict cannot rule or hold a political office or be given an appointment with a company or organisation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Another benefit of being law abiding is that, it is the will of God that we obey and by obeying God we attract His blessings (1Peter 2:13- 17; 1 John 3:4; Luke 20:25).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. By abiding by the law, we are giving glory to God. This is one of the reasons we were created. Therefore, when we are not law abiding, it means that we are dishonouring God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. When we obey laws, we are abiding in good works (Titus 3:1).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.

When we do not obey laws, we sin against God and the reward of sin is destruction.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Disobedience to laws serves as hindrance to answered prayers (Proverbs 28:9).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.

What does it Mean to be Friendly? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word friendly means to be approachable and easy to relate with in character. It also means somebody that has an easy relationship with something or another person without any hostility. A friendly person promotes the good of others. When Saul brought David into his presence, Jonathan devoted himself to David because he had a friendly heart. Despite the fact that he was Sauls eldest son and he was to be the next king, he did not express envy over Davids anointing to be the next king. Rather, Jonathan loved David more than he loved himself. Jonathan and David made a covenant between themselves; by entering into the covenant, Jonathan demonstrated his genuine love with great respect for David. As a result, he gave David his robe and spear which stand for honour. David enjoyed good friendship with Jonathan. In our world today, we look out for people who have great influence and power to occupy leadership positions, but God thinks differently. Developing a good character and being friendly is necessary for being a disciple of Christ. Apostle Peter also listed the following blessings which are borne out of having a good character: Make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance godliness; and to godliness; BROTHERLY KINDNESS; and to BROTHERLY KINDNESS, LOVE. For if you possess these qualities in great measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:5-8).Thus, the Word of God ultimately produces the kind of character that is pleasing to God (Hebrews 4:12).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What are the benefits of being friendly to you and the society as a whole?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II.

Friendship is never inspired by personal gain or recognition. Jesus commendation of Nathaniel as one in whom is no guile, shows Him as a model for us to follow (John 1:47). He had no hidden agenda or manipulative motives. Abrams motives too were pure to his nephew (Genesis 13:8-9).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>iv) Genuineness<\/strong>: Being genuine and honest is essential to being likeable. No one likes a fake.

What is your attitude towards learning new things?<\/p>\r\n","opening_remark":"<p>The lesson from the story is that the student had an unteachable attitude. Instead of listening to the master, he wanted to show how much he already knew and was not open to learning anything new. Since his cup of knowledge was full, he had to empty that cup before he could learn from the master. Emptying our cup does not mean we should give up all we have learned or forget all that we know; that would be wrong. To empty our cup simply means to have a teachable heart. We have to put what we know about something in a corner of our mind and listen to a new explanation, a new lesson, a new teaching and a new insight as a true disciple of Jesus Christ. We need to keep what we have known so that we can acquire new knowledge and benefit from this new learning opportunity. If I may ask, do you have a burning desire to learn? If yes, lets go through this lesson together.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Understanding what it Means to have a Teachable Heart <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be teachable means to have the mind-set of a lifelong learner. It means putting oneself in the position of a learner who is consistently open to learning from anyone at any time. Having a teachable heart is foundational to spiritual growth and relationship development in all areas of our walk with the Lord. The human heart is described as the centre of spiritual activity, moral understanding, and human will. A teachable heart seeks to understand what is going on around him and responds appropriately to what has been learnt. A teachable heart is open to discovering Gods design for differences and even takes the initiative to seek out what makes him and those around him unique. It is a heart that is ready for Gods use at every point in time.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>How can a believer overcome pride and become teachable?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Characteristics of a Teachable Disciple of Christ <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. A teachable disciple of Christ seeks God both when it is convenient and when it is not (Jeremiah 29:13-14; Proverbs 2:3-7).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. A teachable disciple of Christ gives quality time for the study of Gods Word (Deuteronomy 17:18-20; Acts 17:11).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. A teachable disciple of Christ is sensitive and attentive to the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 51:1; Matthew 13:16-17).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. A teachable disciple is humble and meek (Psalm 25: 9; Proverbs 11:2).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. A teachable disciple of Christ thirsts for knowledge. Jesus sat in the midst of the elders, listening and asking questions because He wanted to know more (Proverbs 23:12; Luke 2:46). Also, Paul knew his duty as a minister of the Gospel, that is the reason why he requested for the scrolls and parchments because he needed to inquire more (2 Timothy 4:13).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>f. A teachable disciple of Christ is open-ended. Education is not just something that you acquire while you are in school alone. It takes place anywhere and everywhere and it continues through life. Learning takes place both inside and outside the classroom and both inside and outside the church wall. We are to continue to learn because learning constantly shapes our world view (Proverbs 9:9).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>g. A teachable disciple of Christ is always willing to conform to Gods Word.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>h. A teachable disciple is always on guard against hardness of heart, which the Scripture describes as unwillingness to hear and obey the Word of God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. A teachable disciple of Christ is quick to hear and obey what the Scriptures say, but slow to speak.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>If learning is joyous, explain why teaching is enjoyable<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. A Teachable Heart: A Necessity for Every Disciple<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A true disciple of Jesus Christ needs to be teachable (Acts 2:42). This is the ability to take correction and instruction from someone else. The need to see ourselves as a learner and not a learned person is very essential because:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. It will enable us to be good disciples and have readiness to take instruction from a leader, master or boss.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. As truth sets free so also does learning. Having a teachable heart will set us free from deceit, lying and bondage of illiteracy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. God created humankind with the capacity or ability to learn. Our being alive is for a purpose and to fulfil the purpose for which we were created, we need knowledge. Thus, life is all about learning.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. God commands us to <strong>watch, wait, and search for Him<\/strong>. (Proverbs 8:34-35). These three words are action words, and God instructs us to do this daily! He wants to teach us every day, and what we need to do is to watch daily for those teachable moments from God. Also, we need to search for knowledge (God). He promises that, ...whoever finds me finds life. The book of Amos 5:4 also says seek Me and live!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Having a teachable heart will help us to know insignificant things and live out the most important things of life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.

Proverbs 1:5 highlights why it is needful to seek knowledge: Let the wise listen ... and become even wiser. Let those with understanding receive guidance (NLT). For the disciple to be effective in life and ministry, he or she must be teachable to impact others. Have you put what you think you know aside for God to put His instruction in you?

The book of James 2:23 also confirmed that Abram was called the friend of God. This implies that the two of them (Abram and God) knew each other so well. They also had a good relationship with each other. This made Abram to be focused on His God-given assignment. There are lots of people in the Bible who also had vision, goals or plans for the future, but Abrams surpassed them all because his heart was focused on doing Gods will. In Genesis 15:2-3, Abram inquired from God, what plan He has for him since he didnt have a child to be heir after him. God responded in vv. 4-5. He said that He will give him children as many as the stars. Abram believed God and focused his heart on Gods promise until his desire was granted<\/p>\r\n","opening_remark":"<p>To focus is to direct ones attention to or concentrate on something. As long as we live on the face of this earth, there will be need for us to be focused The search for the purpose of life has puzzled many because we typically begin at the wrong starting point. It is God who directs the lives of His creatures; everyones life is in His power. Life is about letting God use you for His purposes, not you using Him for your own purpose. Becoming what God created you to be by focusing on Him alone is what matters most.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. What is a Focused Heart? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be focused in life simply means to pursue a goal, or intention. It also means to be determined to do something or achieve an aim. The king of Persia known as Xerxes had decided to replace Queen Vashti for her pride and unrelenting attitude. An exiled Jew named Mordecai had a vision that his niece could become the queen. He did not only convince her, the officials in the kings palace also told her that she was a good candidate. Mordecai worked towards the vision and it was eventually fulfilled when his niece, Esther was chosen to be the queen. Soon, Queen Esther had a mission to reverse a decree that had been made to destroy her people (the Jews). She worked very hard until her desire was also achieved successfully. To have a focused heart as a disciple of Jesus Christ, one must have foresight, imagination, ability to anticipate and positively impact the future to accomplish the great commission assigned to us as Christians. Leaders and followers with a focused heart are people who identify the will and purpose of God for their lives and then pursue it with zeal, purposefulness and passion.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What could happen to a life that is not focused?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>I.

How to Stay Focused <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest challenges of achieving our goal is being able to stay focused long enough to see results. Most of us feel excited and motivated when we first set our goals, and that feeling can carry us along for several days, or even weeks. But then, what happens? We begin to lose momentum. We get disorienred, we procrastinate, we lose the fire that once fuelled our dreams. We need to take note of the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. We should be clear about what we desire:<\/strong> When we first set our goals, we must know exactly what we want. We have a clear picture of the outcome in our minds, and we know exactly what to do to make it happen. We should keep the vision strong in our minds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. We should be clear about why we desire it:<\/strong> We must know why we want it. An excellent way to gain insight on this is to write out the goal such as: I want (insert your goal) because it will . . ., and write exactly what it will do for us. How it will make us feel. And then keep following up with questions that go deeper into what we really want. Because once we understand what we really want, we will be much more focused in our efforts to achieve it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. We should set a plan of action:<\/strong> This we can do by defining the action steps that will get us there. This part is actually really simple. Most of us are great at planning, but not so great at taking the actions. Our action steps should be positive thinking with trust in God that He will see us through. Our action steps need to be very detailed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. We should trust God:<\/strong> We need to put our trust in God because without Him, we cannot succeed.

Flood and Its Facts <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word flood is defined by the Oxford word list as an overflow of a large amount of water beyond its normal limits, especially over what is normal dry land. Flooding is now the most frequent type of disaster in the last 10 years all over the world. The effect of flood on peoples health, relationships and welfare is extensive. However, flooding stands out from other types of disasters because, often, it is possible to prevent it by using flood prevention measures. Also its lengthy recovery period afterwards, increases the risks of secondary stressors rising and the impact of worry about recurrence on people who are affected by floods. Furthermore, the impact of climate change is likely to increase the occurrence of flooding. Projected climate-related increases in precipitation are likely to make floods more frequent and severe. Accounts of the psychosocial impacts of flood events suggest that they can have significant effects on peoples well-being, relationships and mental health. Flooding can pose substantial social and welfare problems that may continue over extended periods of time because of the economic stress associated with rebuilding that arise as people try to recover their lives, property and relationships.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What are the effects of flooding?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Flood and the Bible<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the account of the Old Testament, it was recorded that God used flood to end the uproar of humankind because the earth was filled with violence and all manner of evil. But God preserved Noah, his household and two of all other living creatures because he lived a blameless life. After the waters subsided, God made a covenant with Noah saying ...never again will I destroy all living creatures... (Genesis 1:21) With this, the question of Gods anger in relation to todays disasters is intimately connected to the problem of human suffering. After all, how can a loving God cause indiscriminate human misery?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Testament does refer to the Genesis flood when talking about God punishing humankind. For example, Paul the Apostle observed that God brought the flood on the ungodly people of the world but the Epistle of James i.e. a letter in the New Testament says that God tests no one. In fact, those who endure trials are eventually rewarded. The early Christian philosopher Origen argued that through suffering, we can understand our own weaknesses and dependence on God. In this view, suffering is not punishment but when we suffer, it should draw us closer to God and fellow believers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to more contemporary reflections, philosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips argues that it is mistaken to attribute to God a human feeling like anger because God lies beyond human reality. Believing that flood is Gods punishment reduces the divine to human terms. So, instead of dwelling on Gods wrath, we need to understand Gods kindness and mercy.

Some of the consequences are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Health systems will break down.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The education sector, homes and work will suffer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. There will be shortage of food and water supply.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The legal system will be down.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Freedom of the press and free speech will be altered.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Freedom of association will be difficult.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. There will be breakdown of law and order.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>How can we love our enemies in a state where there is war and terrorism?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. War and Terrorism<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Bible In the book of Joshua 6:6-27, following Gods plan, the children of Israel took over the city of Jericho after they marched around the city seven times. In chapters 7-8 of the same book, the Israelites went up to the city of Ai and fought with them and took over their city. The Bible records that there was constant battle between the Israelites and the Philistines. In 1 Samuel 4, the Philistines overcame Israel and killed about 4000 men. In 1 Samuel 15, Saul fought against the Amalekites while in 1 Samuel 17, David fought against Goliath. In Revelations 19:11-21, the Bible speaks of how Jesus Christ will lead the armies at the battle of Armageddon. The Bible accounts show that God supports war, and in a world where there are evil people, sometimes war is necessary to prevent greater evil. If Hitler had not been defeated in World War II, no one can tell how many more millions of people would have been killed? If the American civil war had not been fought, how much longer would African-Americans have had to suffer as slaves? War is a terrible thing but some wars are more devastating than others and war is sometimes the result of sin (Romans 3:10-18). At the same time, Ecclesiastes 3:8 declares there is a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. In a world filled with sin, hatred and evil, war is inevitable. As Christians, we should not desire war and neither should we oppose the government, those whom God has placed in authority over us (Romans 13:1-4; 1 Peter 2:17).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Do you think war sometimes solve conflicts?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Howshoulda Christian Respond to War <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. The Bible says that we are not to take judgement into our own hands but to defer vengeance to God through legitimate established governments. In essence, we should submit to legitimate authorities because they are duty bound to act against those who disobey the law or harm others. We should also submit for the sake of our conscience. Roman 12:17 says &quot;Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Show to the world in these last days what the love of God is like. The show of love in the face of adversity is what distinguishes the Christian from other people (John 13:35). The time of war is a time not only to show Christs love to our brothers and sisters in Christ, but also to others who need to feel and warmth of love in the cold aftermath of loss.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Christians should pray for the safety of those who are demonstrating love to others by their brave actions. The military forces, police, firemen, rescue workers, doctors, nurses and volunteer workers of all kinds are living out Jesus words, &quot;Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends&quot; (John 15:13). We should pray for those who risk their lives for others and set in stark contrast the cowardly acts of terrorists who use the lives of others as a shield for their despicable acts. Lets pray for these men and women and thank God for them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Christians should pray for those who are mistreated and those who were victims. We should pray for friends and families of those who have lost their lives due to war and terrorism and those who heroically continue to fight terrorism. And while we pray for the families of victims of terror, lets pray as well for the families of terrorists. We should pray that Gods grace and love should extend to them too. Lets pray that God will break through their hatred and that the Holy Spirit will soften their hearts and draw them to Him in salvation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. Christians should speak out for understanding, tolerance, justice and forgiveness. While we cannot tolerate the acts of these terrorists, we should understand that their actions arose from their feelings of frustration, helplessness and hopelessness. We have found hope in Christ and so we should rise up to help those who are yet to find hope in Him. We need to be vocal in our insistence that there should be zero tolerance for any reaction of hatred against Muslims, Arabs, or people from the Middle East. By this, we demonstrate the love of Christ. &quot;But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins&quot; (Matthew 6:15).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be a voice for peace in an atmosphere of hatred and retaliation. James said: &quot;My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry. For mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires (James 1:19).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>What should Christians do in times of war and terrorism?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>War and terrorism are inevitable in our society today.

Diseases come to us because we are fallen people living in a fallen world. We get infected by diseases and die because we are imperfect beings living in a world filled with bacteria and viruses that attack our bodies. God sometimes allows sickness so that His purposes might be fulfilled. Jesus said that a man was born blind so that the works of God could be revealed through him (John 9:3), and to bring glory to God (John 11:4). God also use diseases as a judgement against people who are rebellious against Him. In all, whatever God allows, we should know that it is for a reason and we must trust His sovereign wisdom.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Understanding the Term Epidemic <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term Epidemic means a widespread disease that affects many individuals in a population at a particular time. While Disease is an abnormal condition of the body or mind that causes discomfort or dysfunction. Several kinds of diseases affect man and they enter into the body through various means. For example, we have food or water borne diseases, vector borne diseases, water contact diseases, respiratory diseases, aerosolized dust or soil contact diseases and animal contact diseases. Because of their mode of transmission, a lot of persons find it difficult to care for affected persons because they do not want to get infected. Epidemic diseases are being taken care of by the government through her national medical control agencies like NAFDAC, NEMA, etc. and with the support of world aids like WHO for drugs and control measures to fight against the spread of such diseases. At such periods, Christians should seek Gods face for forgiveness of sins on behalf of their nations and divine healing of the land.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What is the difference between disease and epidemic?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II.

He responded to the sick with humane acts intended to alleviate their suffering. He called His followers not to judge anyone, but to emulate His merciful concern and sympathetic actions. Leprosy is one of the diseases prevalent in Jesus days. Lepers at that time were social outcasts, often isolated and ignored. Jesus example is clear. It is recorded in the Bible that He touched the afflicted with His hands and prayed for them. Jesus, along with Peter visited Peters mother in-law, He prayed for her and she was healed (Matthew 8:14-15).

We should have concern for the welfare of our neighbours and give a prompt hand of help when there is need for it. Such help rendered promptly can be a means of restoration of such life. Apostle Peter also did the same by helping to heal the sick at the Beautiful Gate who later went about publicising the healer (Acts 3:2-10). He prayed by faith for his healing which if done the same way today, the same result can be our experience.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>Why are Christians not experiencing miracles like the days of old?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"<p><strong>IV.

When anyone is experiencing any health challenge, the church must rise up to the responsibility of praying for the sick, helping him to receive medical care, regular visitation, giving, counselling, etc. How the sick contacted a disease should not be the barometer by which Christians should determine their attitude or response toward the sick.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> We are to reflect the same covenantal, unconditional posture of love and concern that God freely expresses toward His children, especially visible through His Son Jesus Christ.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> We are to pray for those infected by diseases.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> We are to pray for those in the medical profession who are at the frontline caring for infected persons.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","sharing_time4":"<p>As an individual, what will you do to help the sick or those infected with diseases?<\/p>\r\n","closing_remark":"<p>We recognised that further study in this area is essential for a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by epidemic diseases.

Recession and Its Implication <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term Recess or Recession is a temporary period of reduced economic activity or a cyclical slowdown. A recession is destructive because it creates wide spread unemployment,sometimes as high as 10 percent and when the rate of unemployment increases to 25 percent it becomes a depression and such will have adverse effect on people. As the unemployment rate rises, consumer purchases falls off even more and businesses go bankrupt. From a biblical viewpoint, however, we must ask ourselves whether or not we are experiencing Gods punishment on our nation. Gods punishment on a nation may or may not look like reduced economic activity or cyclical downturns due to market manipulations. God says that He will send economic curses if His people rebel against Him. During recession periods, people lose their homes when they cannot afford to pay, young people cannot get good jobs after school. Some countries like Australia, United Kingdom, United States and China have undergone recession at different times and years. <\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What are the effects of recession?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. The Bible and Recession<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the accounts of the Bible, characters like Abraham, Isaac and countries like Egypt and Israel experienced economic recession at different times. It could be due to sin committed by the people or Gods intention to glorify Himself. The Bible does not necessarily indicate how to overcome recession as much as it explains how to avoid it in the first place (Deuteronomy 28:1-2). In order to be safe from Gods curses and experience His blessings, we must live in obedience to the law of God: But it shall come to pass, if you do not obey the voice of the Lord your God, to observe carefully all His commandments and His statues which I command you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you (Deuteronomy 28:15). God provided a way out for Isaac by giving him his own well which he called Rehoboth. Being a Christian is not an automatic ticket to not experience recession, it however involves living righteously. When a society suffers economic curses, we can safely say that the people have sinned against God and they must repent.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>What are the likely causes of economic recession according to the Bible?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Christians Ideal Response to Economic Recession <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong> The Disciple:<\/strong> We must individually repent and continually pray for repentance at all levels. Pray for our nations economic and political activities, educate our neighbours and future generations on the need to live righteous lives, and pray that God will heal our economy and that the nation will experience economy prosperity.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong> The Family<\/strong>: God instituted the family for the purpose of passing on good heritage from one generation to another. The family has the responsibility of material stewardship, which can be exercised through business and trade (Proverbs 13:22; 2 Corinthians 12:14). Since business, trade, and household financial management are important component of our economy that have lasting impact; members of the family must repent of their sins and live right so that they can enjoy economy prosperity.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong> The Church:<\/strong> The Church is an institution that must call for and lead members in repentance of sins. If the Church fails, all other institutions will also fail. Likewise, if the Church is holy and pure, reformation in all areas of life will follow. The Church is Gods instituted rock, the center and foundation for all of life (Matthew 16:18-19). Gods economic blessings will not come unless His church lays the foundation. Ministers of God must first repent of their sins and live righteously so that they can be good examples for others to follow (Luke 6:39-42).<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong> The Nation:<\/strong> Unlike the family in its proactive economic activities, the nation must return to its biblical limits of being Gods restrainer of evil. The civil governments power and authority should be used only to protect the rights of its citizens.

We must remember that God, not money, is our security:<\/strong> In times of recession, there is very little in life that we actually have control over. We should understand that God, not our resources can provide security. It is tempting for Christians to view the stock market or investments as security. Certainly, a crisis like this is a wake-up call to Christians who fall into the trap of self-sufficiency to trust in God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. We are stewards, not owners:<\/strong> The time of recession is a time of reminder that everything we have or think we own is not really ours but Gods. When we see what we have as Gods, we will be conscious of how we use it. Thus, our role in the bigger picture of Gods plan is one of stewardship and not ownership. And it also invariably grows our faith.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Faith grows during the time of recession:<\/strong> Everyone is often affected during times such as this. We must depend on Gods faithfulness, when things get tough. It is often hard to see how God would make things work, hence, faith becomes all the more important. One of the ways Christians can grow their faith in God is to remain generous in giving, though it sometimes seem difficult. Do we trust that God will provide for our needs? While the rest of the world is losing faith in their governments, banks and even themselves, what a testimony it will be for us.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Learn to live a simple life:<\/strong> It is unfortunate that many are living beyond their means. Our desire for acquisition and accumulation of wealth is part of the reason we got into this financial crisis, and it is one of the things that must be addressed if we want to get out of this mess. We need to put a stop to our obsession of always wanting more.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>As Christians, we can live in this world and enjoy Gods blessings without experiencing recession. However, it depends on our relationship with Christ and the lifestyle we live here on earth. We must live as examples for others to follow in whatever we do if we truly want Gods pleasure and His economic blessing. In addition, there is the need for believers to have a long term plan. The biblical remedy for coming out from and staying away from economic curses is simple - to humble ourselves, repent of our sins and live in obedience to Gods commands (Isaiah 57:15; John 14:15).<\/p>\r\n","activity_period":"<p>1.

In either of these, through prayer we seek Gods peace and wisdom. Also in prayer, we intercede for others. Our prayer will surround them with Gods love and peace when they are not able to do so on their own. There is creative and healing power in prayer. Thus, we are called to love one another whether in times of crisis or when others are weeping. We should be ready to make sacrifices for others, even in hard times. Our church can partner with other churches on the front lines of these unfolding disasters. We can give our time, money, and resources to help those who have lost everything. And most importantly, we can offer fervent prayer for those faced with challenging moments.

It comes from a heart that is attuned to God. The psalmist declared, Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving (Psalm 147:7, NIV). Paul also wrote that we should ... be thankful (Colossians 3:15, NIV). We shall learn alot about thanksgiving in the course of our study today.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. What is Thanksgiving? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanksgiving is the expression of gratitude to God and humankind. Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday celebrated in Canada, the United States and Liberia. It began as a day of giving thanks to God for the blessing of the harvest of the preceding year. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October in Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States and around the same time of the year in other places. Thanksgiving has historical roots in religious and cultural traditions. In the Bible, the meaning of thanksgiving is adoration, sacrifice, praise or an offering. Thanksgiving is a grateful language to God as an act of worship.Rarely, is thanksgiving extended to any person or thing except God. The psalmist in Psalms 42:4 says, These things I remember as I pour out my soul. In Nehemiah 12:27, it was recorded that Nehemiah assembled two great choirs to give thanks for Gods faithfulness in rebuilding the wall. The true meaning of thanksgiving focuses on relationship. Thanksgiving starts from a relationship between God and man. It begins with acknowledging God as faithful, and earnestly giving Him thanks, in advance for His abundant blessings. Philippians 4:6 also states that In everything by prayers and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Thanksgiving is an attitude of the heart that reinforces an intimate relationship with God.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>How can we live a life that is truly thankful?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. What Things Should We Thank God For? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. Thank God for Salvation:<\/strong> The Bible tells us that we are separated from God because we have sinned. But God loves us so much and He wants us to be part of His family forever. He sent His only Son into the world to die as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. All we need to do is to accept Christ by faith as our Saviour and Lord: For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16, NIV). God has given us the greatest gift of all \u2014 His Son, who died on the cross and rose again so that we can know Him personally and spend eternity with Him in heaven. For this reason Paul declared: Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! (2 Corinthians 9:15, NIV).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. Thank God for Material Prosperity: <\/strong>It is unfortunate that we are never satisfied with what God has blessed us with. But what a difference it makes when we realise that everything we own is given to us by God. King David acknowledged this fact when he prayed. He says Wealth and honour comes from you ... We give you thanks, and praise your glorious name ... Everything comes from you (1 Chronicles 29:12-14, NIV).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. Thank God for People around you:<\/strong> We often get angry at any slight provocation by other people because they do not meet our every wish. But we should know that they play important roles in our existence. They make our lives meaningful and blessed. Thus, we need to give thanks for people whom God has blessed us with \u2014 our spouses, children, relatives, friends and others who help us in one way or another.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. Thank God for His Sustaining Presence and Power:<\/strong> When we come to Christ, it is not the end but the beginning of a whole new life. God begins to dwell in us, and He makes Himself available to help us follow Him and do His will. By our strength, we cannot live the way God wants us to live. But when we turn to Him for help, we discover that it is God who works in [us] to will and to act according to his good purpose (Philippians 2:13, NIV). Jesus said to His disciples, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me... Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:18, 20, NIV). He is our strength and it is in Him alone we can get strength. As mentioned earlier, in some countries, a special day is set aside each year for thanksgiving. But for the Christian, every day should not pass without saying words of thanks to God. No wonder Paul stressed the need to always give thanks to God: Always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ(Ephesians 5:20, NIV).<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>What does it mean to live a thankless life?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III.What Should the Response of Christians be to Thanksgiving<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Christ did on our behalf is enough reason we should give thanks to Him at all times.

He was crucified, buried and rose again from the dead on the third day. The psalmist encourages we believers to thank God whenever we come before Him in worship. Appreciating Him for all He has done and what He will yet do will spur Him to do more and answer our prayers whenever we come before Him in prayer. The psalmist understood the nature of God when it comes to thanksgiving that is why he said: Enter His gate with thanksgiving and His court with praise; give thanks to Him and praise His name.

Someone has said, If ingratitude be numbered among the serious sins, then gratitude takes its place among the noblest of virtues. This means, showing gratitude is the first virtue of noble people. God created humanity for gratitude. We exist to appreciate God always. Part of what the first man and woman (Adam and Eve) were created to do was to honour God by being thankful. In other words, part of what we exist to do is to honour God by being thankful and numerous biblical commands enjoining us to show gratitude to God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is quite unfortunate that many believers are failing in their responsibility of appreciating God. We keep reliving the garden story as a cover up for our ingratitude. Our fall was, has always been, and always will be that we arent satisfied in God and what He gives. We hunger for something more, something other than what God gave through Adam and Eve, and which is being transferred to us. Both before our conversion and after, we are unthankful people. This is a painful truth.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By faith in Jesus Christ, we are redeemed from ingratitude and eternal penalty in hell. We are now free to enjoy the pleasure of being doubly thankful for Gods favour towards us - not only as His creatures, but also as His redeemed people. Apostle Paul encourages Christians to live lives characterised by thanksgiving. Only in Jesus are we able to become the kind of persistently thankful people God created us to be.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Why are human beings ingrates despite all the blessings of God to us?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Thanksgiving as an Attitude:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfulness is an attitude to choose. The more we become blessed in terms of physical wealth, the harder thankfulness tends to be; and the more likely we forget God because all our possessions dominate our attention. The reason is not farfetched; we have to pay for them, we have to take care of them and insure them. We hope nothing goes wrong with them. And we fall in love with them. Thanksgiving is equally an attitude of choice. An attitude of thanksgiving makes a merry heart. And a merry heart is like medicine. It takes the grace of God to go through a day, week, month and year, challenges notwithstanding. Yet, many find it difficult to show gratitude to God for His mercy. A praisefull and thankful heart always sees reason to praise God and be happy whether in good times or in bad times. Thankfulness is like a light in a dark world. An attitude of thanksgiving affects our thoughts, words and actions. It affects our relationships, responses to issues including offences (which will surely come). Furthermore, it affects our choices and certainly our tomorrow. As simple as it may seem, to cultivate an attitude of thanksgiving is not easy for many people. This is because some persons see it as foolishness, though it is the wisest thing to do to enjoy a prosperous and glorious year. Others find it justifiable to murmur and complain. Amazingly, many people think it is necessary to worry over issues. Thanksgiving is a time to re-evaluate our attitude towards God. Our attitude determines our altitude.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Ways to Express the Attitudes of Thanksgiving:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bible is full of writings on thanksgiving especially the book of Psalm. This book was used by the nation of Israel as a psalm of thanks to God. As they gathered to worship, they used this psalm to reflect on the attitude of their hearts. As believers, we must cultivate the following attitudes:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a. An Attitude of Worship:<\/strong> We are all worshippers. At one time or the other, we worship or value something. But the question we need to ask ourselves is what do I value? For many of us, what or who we worship may not be what we ought to worship. The bitter truth is that whatever we worship is our god. The main reason why God created us is to worship Him and nothing else. But unfortunately, many worship other things as god whether deliberately or unknowingly. We exist for one purpose alone\u2014to reflect Gods matchless glory. God wants us to gladly and excitedly express our love to Him.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b. An Attitude of Thanks:<\/strong> We thank God because of who He is and what He has done.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c. An Attitude of Belonging:<\/strong> Our God is our Ruler and Master. We need to recognise who God is and who we are. If we create something, we have the right to request the worship of that thing. Since God created us, we have no choice but to worship Him. When we do this, God will guide us to the place of security, plenty and rest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d. An Attitude of Reception:<\/strong> God has called us to receive the love He has given us. We should be thankful because of Gods love for us.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>Let class members mention things we ought to be thankful for?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Basically, thanksgiving is the act of expressing specific gratitude to God for blessings He has bestowed upon us. God appreciates our thanksgiving. It lifts Him up from His throne and it glorifies Him. Thanksgiving endears Him to us, it also draws us closer to Him. If we remain ingrates and do not express our thanks to Him, then He will draw far away from us. One of the signs of a carnal heart is being unthankful. The attitude of thanksgiving can overcome destructive attitudes like: bitterness, complaining, murmuring, and discouragement. Every believer should live a life filled with the attitude of thanksgiving for the fact that we have been delivered from darkness to light.<\/p>\r\n","activity_period":"<p>How can we allow the attitude of thanksgiving change our life and family?<\/p>\r\n","roadmap":""},{"id":46,"devotional_date":"NOVEMBER WEEK 3","topic":"TYPES OF THANKSGIVING","hymn":"BH 6 Praise to the Lord, the Almighty","scripture":"Philippians 4:4-7","teaching_method":"Discussion","learning_outcome":"<p>Members will understand the various types of thanksgiving by:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I.

Biblical Concept of Thanksgiving <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the Old Testament, when the Jewish people were walking right with God, they thanked Him for protection from their enemies, deliverance and for keeping the covenant He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They also thanked God for the miracles He did for them. The Jewish people appreciated what God did for them by making thanksgiving a part of their religious ceremonies and customs. King David appointed Levitical priests to offer thanks to God, as he knew how important it is to God. This custom was then carried on by both King Solomon and King Hezekiah. In the New Testament, Apostle Paul encourages us to give thanks in all things. Every Christian should be thankful to God in his\/her personal walk with the Lord.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>Can we thank God enough for all His blessings spiritual, physical, and emotional?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Truths about Thanksgiving:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanksgiving is a pervasive and essential concept in the Scripture. Although it is good to set aside a Sunday in November to express our heart of thanksgiving, the Scriptures have more to say about giving thanks than setting aside a day in a year. Thanksgiving is celebration of joy and joy is the surest sign of the presence of God. When King Solomon began to reign over Israel, he unexpectedly experienced Gods presence while praying outside the temple. Awed and inspired by this heavenly encounter, Solomons immediate response was unbridled thankfulness and joy - a joy so great that the king called for a raucous nationwide fifteen day festival of celebration and dedication to God. Probably the closet modern parallel to this event is the celebration of thanksgiving. This is a nationally mandated day of rest and reflection, a time to gather together with friends and family and give thanks to God for His goodness throughout the year. Imagine the president mandating that everyone in the country should celebrate this festival for two weeks, with celebration each day! The fact about thanksgiving is that for the Christian, every single day is Thanksgiving Day; a day to celebrate what God is doing in our lives and to reflect on His goodness and grace. It is a day to experience Gods presence, to hear from Him and obey Him.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Why do you think it is important for a country to set aside a day for national thanksgiving holiday?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III. Types of Thanksgiving:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanksgiving should be done as inspired by the Holy Spirit. We have to realise that without God, we are nothing - and that we can literally lose everything we have in a very short period of time. Thus, we should always show our heart of appreciation to God. Some types of a thankful and grateful heart are as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> Gratefulness expressed to another individual<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Act of expressing gratitude<\/li>\r\n\t<li> To declare the merits of someone<\/li>\r\n\t<li> The aspect of praise that gives thanks to God for what He does for us<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Natural expression of thanks in response to blessings, protection or love<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Gratitude is not a tool used to manipulate the will of God, rather it is a joyful commitment of ones personality to God<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Learn to say thank you! This can be done by showing your gratitude on social media. Making a great post on how to say thankful you are over social media, writing personalised thank you notes to your best clients can show them how thankful you are.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Give Back. This can be something small like a discount or something big like writing off the whole bill. When your customers give you so much, find a way to appreciate them by giving them something in return.

And as we grow daily, so should our attitude towards thanksgiving improve. Our relationship with Jesus Christ should transform us into a joyful, positive and grateful soul. One sign that shows that Jesus Christ is living in our heart is gratitude. A right attitude is very crucial to many things we do. When we have the right attitude, we will be able to appreciate God and others for all blessings that come our way.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Having an Attitude of Gratitude<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some ways of showing an attitude of gratitude to God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Remember that showing gratitude pleases God<\/strong>: Gratitude makes God happy. Gods presence was felt by the people in response to their thanksgiving (2 Chronicles 5:13-14). God loved to hear the praise from the temple and so He drew near. Thanksgiving and praise are the keys to attracting the presence of God.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Avoid complaining at all costs:<\/strong> Complaining and grumbling are the major barriers to gratitude. We must learn to control ourselves when we complain and stop it right away. Also, we need to avoid complaining because God hates it and it is capable of ruining our spiritual lives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Make a choice to rejoice come what may:<\/strong> It may be difficult to be thankful at certain times but we need to make a personal decision to be grateful even when we do not feel like or when it is hard for us to do so. Apostle Paul wrote these words from prison, &quot;Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say it rejoice.&quot; Paul emphasised the word rejoice by saying it twice in that verse of the Scripture. Paul made a personal decision to be joyful despite his circumstances, he decided that even though he was in prison it didnt matter, he was going to praise and thank God anyway. In the end, his decision transformed his situation. Gratitude is a choice but we have to make a conscious decision that we are going to be grateful to God despite the circumstances of our life (1 Thessalonians 5:18).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Develop daily discipline of giving thanks:<\/strong> To be thankful people begins by daily giving thanks to God. It is a discipline that believers must imbibe. No matter how small our blessing may seem, we must learn to search out the positive in the midst of the negative and give thanks. A popular hymn says, &quot;Count your many blessings, name them one by one and it will surprise you what the Lord has done.&quot;<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>How can we recognise Gods hand in anything we undertake?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. Ways of Developing an Attitude of Gratitude <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Write it down:<\/strong> In order to remember, keep a gratitude journal. Be specific about what you are thankful for. When you practice gratefulness, there is a sense of respect you will command towards others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Talk about it:<\/strong> Sharing what you are thankful for isnt just for the sake of thanksgiving but to encourage others as well. Making time out to talk about what you are grateful for is important all year long. It will reinforce your feelings and that of others. Someone says if you are really thankful, what do you do? You share it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Meditate on it:<\/strong> Whether you regularly meditate or not, take a break for a few times a day. Focus with a spirit of thankfulness. Who are you thankful for? Bring the person to mind. Imagine your life is surrounded with blessings from that person.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Express it:<\/strong> Find that teacher who made a difference in your life and tell him or her how much you are grateful. Write a personal note to a long lost friend, telling him\/her what he\/she meant to you. Someone once said, Gratitude is the most exquisite form of courtesy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.

Building a Right Attitude of Thanksgiving to God <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, when we are thankful, we recognise God at work in our lives. Our thoughts are projected toward God, the object of our gratitude (Psalm 107:1). Thanksgiving makes us aware that God is at work in our midst.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, as we express our thanks to God, we also generate genuine feelings of affection and love toward our heavenly Benefactor. We learn to love God through receiving His love. His love is expressed in Christs dying on the cross for us and our sins. It is also partly revealed through His daily goodness and blessing on our lives. As we recount these things, our love for Him is established and strengthened.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, thoughtful and heartfelt thanksgiving promotes faith towards God because, it recounts all the good that God has done for us. The remembrance of what God has done builds confidence in the believer to continue to trust God. It also enhances the faith of the believer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourthly, heartfelt thanksgiving prepares us for worship. Through thanksgiving, we develop a right attitude towards God, one of awareness, faith, love, and worship.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We must pause daily, perhaps at the start of the day and surely at its close, to thank God. When we deliberately take time to think about God, His redemption in Jesus Christ, all His benefits, and all our blessings, there can be only one result - thanksgiving.

But can we say that giving thanks in difficult and painful situations is easy? Does having a grateful heart while suffering make any sense. It is easy to be grateful for when experiencing good things like the birth of a newborn baby, a promotion, a new house, or encouraging news from the doctor.  But what if you lose your job, your child is on drugs, or you are told by the doctor that you have only six months to live? One may ask, how can God expect me to be grateful then?

Benefits of Giving Thanks <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a habit of thanksgiving is one of the best things anyone can do to increase his\/her health and happiness. Thanksgiving is emphasised by all the great religious traditions and it is an important component of many spiritual practices. Here are ten exceptional reasons to develop an attitude of thanksgiving.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Thanksgiving makes you happier:<\/strong> Even when you are already happy, thanksgiving makes you happier. It can even lift your spirit man in times of depression. There is evidence that the more grateful one is, the less likely he\/she experience depression. In fact, it shows that consistent positive interactions, particularly ones that involve gratitude, increase happiness and decrease levels of depression.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Thanksgiving improves your relationships:<\/strong> Being grateful helps you make and keep friends, and strengthen relationships of all kinds. Thanksgiving helps you connect and empathise with others. Expressing gratitude can enhance marriages and make relationships to be more resilient.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Thanksgiving makes you a better person:<\/strong> Being grateful makes you an all-around nicer and more likable person. Those who regularly express gratitude are less materialistic and more spiritual. They are less self-centered and have better selfesteem. Grateful people are more sensitive, less likely to be envious, and less likely to be aggressive or revenge seekers. Gratitude enhances their sense of responsibility toward future generations which makes them better stewards of their environment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Thanksgiving makes you healthier:<\/strong> Feeling and expressing thanksgiving can make you healthier and it may even help you live longer. It reduces stress and increases emotional resilience. It helps you sleep better, especially if you do gratitude exercises before bed. Grateful people are more likely to take care of themselves even to eat healthy, exercise, and take measures to manage stress.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Thanksgiving can give your career a boost:<\/strong> Whether you are an employee, entrepreneur, or business owner, giving thanks can make you more successful. Being grateful can increase productivity and enhance your decision making skills. It can also make you a better manager and help you understand and relate with your customers, co-workers, and clients well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Thanksgiving keeps us continually aware that the Lord is close by:<\/strong> Even though gratefulness doesnt come naturally in difficult circumstances, a decision to thank God for walking with us through life makes us more sensitive to His comforting presence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. It motivates us to look for His purpose in our circumstances:<\/strong> Knowing that God allows problems and difficulties for His good purpose takes the edge off the pain. Even if we do not understand why we are going through suffering, we can thank God because we know that in His time, He will work it out for our good. In the meantime, we can rest in the knowledge that He is using what we are passing through to transform us into the image of His Son (Romans 8:28:29)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Thanksgiving helps bring our will into submission to Gods will:<\/strong> When the situation we are experiencing is the last thing we ever wanted, thanking God is a giant step towards being able to follow Christs example and saying not my will but yours be done. Gratitude helps us to acknowledge that Gods will is best even if it is hard; in that way, we are able to release our hold on what we want. Although the circumstance may remain the same, submission changes our hearts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. It reminds us of our continual dependence on God:<\/strong> Pride, adequacy and independence evaporates whenever we are trapped in a situation that leaves us helpless and hopeless. If there is no way out, thanking God for His control over all things reminds us that He alone is our strength.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Thanking God focuses our attention on Him rather than our<\/strong> <strong>circumstances:<\/strong> The key to a grateful heart begins with understanding Gods character because knowing His awesome attributes motivates trust and gratitude. He knows exactly what youre going through. He loves you unconditionally and understands you perfectly. When you thank Him in tough times, He gets bigger and the circumstances get smaller.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>How can we thank God in times of disappointments and pains?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III.

Background of the Inspired Writer <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A remarkable and one of the worlds greatest Gospel hymn writers of the English Hymnody, Isaac Watts composed this hymn. He was born on July 17, 1674 at Southampton, England to the family of Enoch Watts, a cobbler, clothier and dissenting schoolmaster, who kept a boarding house at Southampton and suffered imprisonment for his convictions. As a young man, he was offered education at either Oxford or Cambridge University with the hope that he will be ordained in the Church of England which he eventually rejected and made his way to an independent Academy at Stoke Newington. After his graduation, he returned to Southampton where he wrote many hymns with which he became famous. These hymns were later published in 1707 and 1709. Sometime later, he was called to pastor a distinguished independent congregation in Mark Lane, London. During his pastorate, he engaged in an intense theological and philosophical study that weakened his health. His serious illness demanded the call of an assistant to help in carrying out the pastoral responsibilities. Since then, he spent the rest of his life in the home of Sir Thomas Abney serving as a chaplain to the family and he occasionally preached in his church. Inspite of his ill-health, he never ceased in leading in dissenting churches in London by carrying out a voluminous correspondence with religious leaders of New England. He published 60 other books covering many scholarly fields. He was a notable English hymnody who composed many hymns that are in use in many denominations.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>What lesson can you learn from the composers life?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. The Hymn Interpretation <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hymn is an imitation of one of the psalms of David in the language of the New Testament rather than the Old. Isaac Watts through this hymn presents Psalm 98 with a New Testament insight as a paraphrase of the last half of Psalm 98 - Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth; make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise... let the hills be joyful together before the LORD, for he cometh to judge the earth; with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with Equity. Although, Psalm 98 is a Jewish song of celebration as regards the marvellous ways through which God demonstrated His protection and restoration of His chosen people. The anticipation of the time when Jehovah will be the God of the whole earth and Israels law will be acceptable by all nations is the content of this psalm. However, the message of God revealing Himself to humankind in human form is being stressed. Thus, the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14). Isaac Watts through this hymn reveals a new way of expressing praise to God for our salvation when God became incarnate as the babe of Bethlehem who ordained to cancel the curse brought to man as a result of the fall of Adam. Initially, Isaac Watts titled the text The Messiahs Coming and Kingdom. Besides this hymn, Isaac Watts may have written not less than six hundred psalms and hymns and is thus identified as the father of English Hymnody.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we express joy and declare to people the birth of our Saviour, we shall sing stanzas 1 and 2.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>1. Joy to the world! the Lord is come; Let earth receive her King;  Let every heart Prepare Him room, And heaven and nature sing, And heaven and nature sing, And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>2.

The celebration of joy is not to cause His people to sin. It is joy that makes Gods blessings to flow on everyone. This is expressed in stanza 3 as all creatures far as the curse is found will be blessed by the Lord. In stanza 4, he presented that the style of Christs rule is truth and grace rather than deceit. It is of righteousness, not feigned love.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>3. No more let sins and sorrows grow, Nor thorns infest the ground; He comes to make His blessings flow Far as the curse is found, Far as the curse is found, Far as, far as the curse is found.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>4.

It is an early form of sacred folk music dating far back as the early middle ages. It is usually a religious folk song or popular hymn particularly associated with Christmas. In todays series of Christmas hymn, we shall be examining While Shepherds Watched their Flocks. This hymn narrates the significant role of the shepherds on the night when Christ Jesus was born. It is observed that besides the shepherds, no other professionals were mentioned during the birth of Jesus Christ. No wonder, the celebration of Christmas is highly inclusive of all gender, ethnicity, races, nations and continents.<\/p>\r\n","interaction1":"<p><strong>I. Background of the Inspired Writer<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hymn was composed as a narrative of the angels announcement of Jesus birth to the shepherds. It was penned by Nahum Tate, the son of an Irish clergyman. He studied at Trinity College, Dublin. He was appointed as poet laureate of England for the court of William during the reign of William and Mary (1689-1702). His professional achievements sharply contrasted with his private life as he was a drunkard and that resulted in his degradation. He died in a debtors refuge in London, England at the age of 63.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>List some ways you have added value to other church members live<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. The Hymn Interpretation <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hymn gives the account of the shepherds awareness of Jesus Christs birth and the part played by them. Shepherds generally are known for protecting their sheep at all season of the year. In ancient times, shepherds will not leave their flock of sheep alone till far night. No wonder that night when Jesus Christ was born, they were still in fields keeping watch over their sheep when the angel of the Lord beckoned to them and announced His birth.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By nature, sheep are fearful animals that cannot lie down except they feel totally secure. Inspite of this, the shepherds responded to the tiding of the angel which was a great risk. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid ... for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. (Luke 2:9-11, NKJV) They did not only listen to this message of the angel but responded by saying Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass (v. 15). The shepherd took the message of Christs birth in great faith and acted on the message. At the end, the shepherds glorified and praised God for the news they heard and what they witnessed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is this narration that inspired Nahum Tate to write his personal psalm focusing on the part played by the shepherds at Jesus Christs birth. Lets sing the first and second stanzas.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>1. While shepherds watched their flocks by night, All seated on the ground, The angel of the Lord came down, And glory shone around, And glory shone around.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Fear not! said he; for mighty dread Had seized their troubled mind, Glad tidings of great joy I bring, To you and all mankind, To you and all mankind.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This new psalter known as the New Version was met with widespread resistance at first with official endorsement by King William for the Church of England. It later came to America for adoption via American Episcopal Church in 1789. In spite of his unfortunate private life of drunkenness and unwise spending, he was useful in narrating the biblical story of Jesus Christs birth. The music tune for this hymn was adopted from one of the works of a musician, George Fredrick Handel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sharing Time: <\/strong>Mention the name of someone who was used by God in spite of his\/her wayward lifestyle and explain how God used him or her. The first and second lines of stanza three, To you in Davids town this day is born of Davids line, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord... is a proclamation of the angel to Joseph about what the name of the child would be and the purpose of His birth: He would save His people from their sins.But here, to the shepherds, the angel refers to Jesus as Christ the Lord. The angel gave vivid description of when, where and how Jesus would be born. He also mentioned the lineage of His birth. In addition, the angel told the shepherds the unusual as to where the baby will be found. It is unusual to give birth to a baby in a place where sheep are kept. The angel told them that they will find a baby lying in a manger in Bethlehem as a sign of recognition for the shepherds. This is indeed a mystery. It is beyond the ability of anyone to grasp it. Despite the issues surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ, He never ceases to be the Lord. We shall now sing the third and the fourth stanza solemnly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>3. To you, in Davids town, this day Is born, of Davids line, The Saviour, who is Christ the Lord; And this shall be the sign: And this shall be the sign.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.

Glory is associated with the word doxology. It also means all praise to God. The shepherds gave all glory to God for His gift to humankind and for the peace which the birth of Christ brings to the world. They sang a song of reformation: Soli Deo Gloria meaning all glory, all honour, all worship, all praise be given to God. The peace proclaimed here does not refer to the peace that is experienced after rest from warfare, but the peace that comes as a result of the Gospel: being justified by faith, we have peace with God. That is, by putting our total trust in Jesus Christ, the warfare between us and God has been done away with. We have been reconciled to God through Christ. In assurance of the peace we have received through our Lord Jesus Christ, let us sing stanza five joyfully.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>5. All glory be to God on high, And to the Earth be peace; Good will henceforth from heavn to men, Begin and never cease; Begin and never cease!<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sharing Time:<\/strong> At what moments do we need to give glory to God?<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"","interaction3":"<p><strong>III.Inspired Practical Lessons <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li> The Hymn tells us that everyone is important to God. It was the shepherds\u2014a very unlikely group that were the first to receive such an invite because shepherds were despised and mistrusted by everyone of those days. To many people, shepherds were like gypsies, vagrants, carnival workers, and con men all rolled into one. They were looked down upon as among the lowest class of people in the world. So looking at the shepherds experience, it shows that all people are important to God. He sent His only Son because He loves all of us not just a group of people.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> The shepherds experience reminds us that Jesus birth heralded wonderful news. Do not be afraid! These words are not only meant to calm the fears and anxiety of the shepherds, they are for everyone. They are meant for all people! This is wonderful news indeed for believers. As fallen beings living in a fallen world, we have a lot of things to be afraid of but thanks be to God who sent His Son to remove every bit of fear and doubt from our lives. So, a study of the shepherds helps us to understand that everyone is important to God and that Jesus birth heralded good news for us all.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> How they handled the Good News received from the angel shows that what we do with the Good News makes all the difference. In making this announcement, God by-passed other notable individuals and used those who were looked down upon in the society. God still does this today; He by-passes those who feel they are the big ones and communicates with nobodies. Therefore, we must be very careful in our relationships with God and fellow men.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> The shepherds had no reason to fear because they were innocent. Anyone who is lost in sin has every reason to fear.<\/li>\r\n\t<li> Gifts are beautifully wrapped. Jesus is the Fathers gift to the world. By accepting Him into our lives, we behold the beauty of His presence through salvation. We are expected to share the good news about Jesus Christ as a gift for the human race. Since we have professed Christ as our Saviour and Lord, we must also spread the news to the unreached people far and near.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>In what ways can a believer underrate or devalue another person?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>The celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ is universal and includes all human races.

Background of the Inspired Writer<\/strong> This Christmas hymn was authored by a renowned hymn writer, Charles Wesley who lived between 1707 and 1788. The original version of this hymn appeared in a book called Hymns and Sacred Poem in 1739 with the title Hark, how all the welkin rings, Glory to the King of kings. George Whitefields collection of hymns for social worship (1753) contained the present form of the first two lines. This hymn came to birth when singing of hymns seem to have been an integral part of the early misery and miracle plays, which were widely used by the medieval in the early church for teaching religious dogmas. As at then, the carols were sung as an interval between the various scenes of the dramas. Charles Wesleys Hark! The Herald Angels Sing represents one of the few important carols during the period. The lyrics of the carol present biblical doctrine in poetic language. This shows the credibility of the hymn.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>As a Christian who has just discovered a poetic gift, how can such gift be put to use?<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. The Hymn Interpretation<\/strong> The biblical reference to this hymn is <em>But thou Bethlehem Ephrathah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the one to be ruler in Israel whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting<\/em> (Micah 5:12). This hymn proclaims the arrival of baby Jesus, the purpose of His coming, the Kings home town and the unexpected significance in spite of who He is. Hark! The Herald invites humankind to proclaim the news of Gods love to the earth. Bethlehem is presented as the focus town and place of His birth. Bethlehem means House of Bread while Ephrata locates the village in a known region in Judah (Genesis 35:16). It is a small community where the King of kings and the Lord of lords was born.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conversion of Charles Wesley inspired him to write sacred poems that we now sing as hymns. Each of his hymns is fully packaged with sound doctrine. The hymns are loaded with beauty and theological brawn. He wrote nothing less than six thousand, five hundred (6,500) hymns and Hark! The Herald is one of them. It is sung as a Christmas carol. It was written when Charles Wesley was twenty-two years old. Its original text reads:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;Glory to the King of kings&quot; Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled Joyful all ye nations rise Join the triumph of the skies Universal nature say Christ the Lord is born to day!<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The first line of the above text is Hark, how al the welkin rings is an old English term for the vault of heaven - Glory to the King of kings. The polishing of this carol was done by Charles friend, evangelist George Whitfield. The hymn conveys the angels in worship and adoration in Gods presence. It presents the deity of Christ and His mission to humankind. The message is that Christ is born in Bethlehem. Jesus is our Emmanuel meaning Jesus is God with us and He was born to give us a second birth (Matthew 1:23). But as many as received Him to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name; who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God(John 1:12-13). This is the reality of our second birth. Lets imitate the angels of old as we sing stanza 1<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Hark! The herald angels sing, (Males)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Glory to the newborn King; (Females)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peace on earth, and mercy mild; (Males)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>God and sinners reconciled.

(All)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hark! The herald angels sing, (All)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glory to the newborn King. (All)<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This first stanza describes the angels invitation for humankind to join them in the praise of Jesus Christ. The entire hymn presents the truths of the virgin birth, Christs deity, immortality of the soul, the new birth and prayer for the transforming power of Jesus Christ in our lives as believers. The hymns by Charles Wesley were composed in order that men and women might be led into truth by the gentle hand of the melody and rhyme. As observed by a writer, Charles Wesleys tune of the hymn was adapted from one of Mendelssohns earlier works. Felix Mendelssohn was an early nineteenth century composer. The tune Mendelssohn was written to commemorate the four hundredth anniversary of the invention of printing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sharing Time: <\/strong>Why is it necessary for believers to always sing praise to God?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we conclude this hymn, we shall rise and sing stanzas two and three.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>2. Christ, by highest heavn adored, Christ, the everlasting Lord; Late in time, behold Him come, Offspring of a virgins womb. Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, Hail th incarnate Deity!

The herald angels sing, &quot;Glory to the newborn King.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We are reminded of imago Dei in the phrase, Stamp Thine image in its place, taking of the image of God in place of that of sinful Adam. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, highlights the virgin birth, the universal application of the coming of th Incarnate Deity to all nations, and that Christ, who was pleased with us in flesh to dwell, gives humanity a second birth. The second or new birth is essential to anyone who does not want to experience the second death. The final stanza of this hymn paraphrases the beautiful biblical citation from Malachi 4:2: But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings (KJV).

The translation of the three stanzas in our Baptist Hymnal is credited to Fredrick Oakely (1802-1880) and others. The initial set up of the stanzas was four as been used by the Catholic congregation. It was later compressed by the Protestants into three stanzas. It is sung by nearly all church groups in the world. It has been translated into more than a hundred languages.

The Hymn Interpretation The first stanza of the hymn calls us as believers to visualise the infant Jesus in the stable at Bethlehem. The second stanza is usually omitted in most hymnals. This stanza reminds us that Jesus Christ is God Himself.

Believe me that I am in the Father and Father in Me ...(John 14:11) The third stanza tells of the exalted song of the angelic choir heard by the lowly shepherds who were watching over their flocks by night. In the last stanza, we are directed to offer praise and adoration to Jesus our Lord, who was with the Father right from the beginning or existence of time. This was revealed by John in his gospel: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. (John 1:1- 3) <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, lets sing the first, second and the third stanza together with the refrain. 1.

The Background of the Inspired Writer<\/strong> This Christmas hymn was composed in the nineteenth century. It is one of the oldest hymns still sung in the Church today. It is the liturgy of St. James. Liturgy means a way of praying in a religious service using a fixed order of words (Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English). The authorship of this liturgy was disputed. However, it has been associated with St. James, one of the twelve apostles. Some claim that he wrote it in the early 60AD. Others claim it has similarity with the liturgy of St. Cyril of Jerusalem in the fourth century. Not minding the specification of the date of writing it, it was written for use in the Church of Jerusalem towards the beginning of the fifth century. It became a liturgy of both the Jerusalem and Antioch Church, thus regarded as St. James liturgy. John Witvliet referred to it as an Antiphon of St. James.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time1":"<p>List or mention some prayers that can be regarded as liturgy in the Christian faith<\/p>\r\n","interaction2":"<p><strong>II. The Hymn Interpretation<\/strong> This Christmas hymn expresses a cherubic prayer that is chanted by priests when the bread and wine are brought to the table of the Lord. It is used to call peoples attention to reverence God in worship: The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him(Habakkuk 2:20). It also presents the Lord as One who is exalted and raised up out of His holy habitation (Zechariah 2:13).Gerard Moultrie translated the text of this hymn from Greek and published a paraphrase in a book titled: Prayer of the Cherubic Hymn. Some of the lyrics have been altered for more clarity. The Baptist Hymnal omits the second stanza - King of kings yet born of Mary. The hymn is sung solemnly with relevant choice instrument. Lets rise to sing stanza one:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Let all mortal flesh keep silence, And with fear and trembling stand; Ponder nothing earthly-minded, For with blessing in His hand, Christ our God to earth descendeth, Our full homage to demand.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tune for this hymn is PICARDY which is a French carol from the seventeenth century and from the song book Chansons Populaires des Provinces de France. The book was published in 1860, but the hymn was first published in Great Britain in 1864. It has a sorrowful (minor) tonality and expresses a sense of awe and majesty that the text evokes. This hymn can be used during the Lords Supper although it is best used during the Christmas season. Let us sing stanza two and three:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Rank on rank the host of heaven Spreads its vanguard on the way, As the Light of light descendeth From the realms of endless day, That the powrs of hell may vanish As the darkness clears away.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. At His feet the six-winged seraph; Cherubim, with sleepless eye, Veil their faces to the presence, As with ceaseless voice they cry, Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Lord Most High.<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time2":"<p>Does keeping silent before God mean reverencing Him?<\/p>\r\n","interaction3":"<p><strong>III.Inspired Practical Lessons<\/strong> The lessons in this hymn are the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence is simply a beautiful hymn about the incarnation which is closely associated with the Christmas season. In singing this hymn, we think more about Gods kindness to humankind for sending His Son in the image of man, to be our Saviour.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. The hymn is filled with mysteries as written in Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4. It invites the singer to participate in giving praise to the incarnation, a sense of entering the Holy of Holies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. The essence of this hymn is to aid worship. It teaches us about God and functions as a guide for the believer in devotion to God. Let us all join the angels in singing Gods praises to His glory - Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Lord Most High!<\/p>\r\n","sharing_time3":"<p>How can a believer demonstrate humility before God when singing this Christmas hymn?<\/p>\r\n","interaction4":"","sharing_time4":"","closing_remark":"<p>Hymn singing is better sung with drums but we cannot sing all hymns with drums. For this hymn to convey its message, we should be mindful of accompanying it with drums. In addition, we should reflect sensitively on the message and tonality of the hymn.<\/p>\r\n","activity_period":"<p>1. Should Christmas carol service be centred on choir(s) renditions alone? Discuss.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. What would have been your reaction if you were one of the shepherds who heard the angels on the first Christmas night? In what ways can a believer behold and adore Jesus Christ this Christmas season?<\/p>\r\n","roadmap":"<p>The Christmas season is a wonderfully all-encompassing festival period. It is celebrated by both Christians and all people in one way or the other since the Middle Ages through music, dancing, feasting and drinking. Hymn singing is another aspect of celebrating the season of Christs birth and we must teach them to our children. Christmas hymns are paraphrased from the Bible for the lifting of our souls in worship and praise of Christ the born King. We can sing Christmas hymns in an organised end of the year party in organisations, schools, fellowships and during worship. Through singing of Christmas hymns many lives will be blessed to the glory of God.<\/p>\r\n"}]
